1,"When I was younger I would debate whether I relate the most to Ron or perhaps Luna or Neville or maybe even Dumbledore but as I got older I’ve realized that non of it is right. Nowadays the character that I find the most relatable is professor Binns.                                                            A man that was so done with life during the life itself that he didn’t even realized he died. He just died in a chair and carried on as if nothing had happened. And I find that extremly relatable. Because honestly over the years of my life so many things had happened that death would just be yet another thing on my long list of misery. It’d be like “yeah, I guess that’s what is happening now”

It’s just a joke post please don’t take it to seriously with comments like: death is not funny, I know that. But this post is not that serious so please don’t attack me in the commentsWhy as an adult I find prof. Binns to be the most relatable character"
1,"Harry was absolutely fated to die and she picked that up in the first second. 

She misinterpreted Sirius as the grim but honestly that's like a doctor confusing one type of cancer for another, she saw the signs and interpreted them the way a professional in her field should. If you're a seer and you see a spectral dog you don't think ""secret animagus"" you think ""grim"" because occam's razor. 

Literally every prediction she made came true in retrospect. Harry did have a short life line, etc. The only thing she missed was that he'd come back after his death, and honestly I'd like to believe she saw that too but convinced herself it was too far-fetched.Trelawny was right about everything."
1,"I’ve always wanted a Harry Potter book that was just...no action. I would love just a 600 page book of normal Hogwarts everyday life. Those are always my favorite parts of the books, when they’re just hanging out, complaining about their homework, doing wizard things, eating crazy cool food at magical feasts, quidditch practice, stuff like that. It probably wouldn’t sell very well, but I would read it to the death.I don’t need any action"
1,"There’s some unreleased footage that I wouldn’t mind seeing but I simply do not want more of Harry Potter.I don’t want a Harry Potter series or a sequel, I just want them to release the unseen deleted scenes"
1,"""’*Ginny*!’ said Mr Weasley, flabbergasted. ’Haven't I taught you *anything*? What have I told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself *if you can't see where it keeps its brain.""*

1,"I mean, he’s always up at night to check if there are any students out of bed, and he seems to always be wandering in the castle during the day looking for students to punish and cleaning stuff too.When does Argus Filch sleep??"
1,Every time I rewatch the goblet of fire I am baffled that the scriptwriters though that it made sense to have Draco ridicule the weasleys for having seats high up in order to watch a sport where people fly around in the air on broomsticks. In what world is being high up a disadvantage here. Like what were they thinking??Quidditch World Cup
1,"I was just laying here thinking about the goblins. They must have their own towns, right? My guess is they've got a hidden underground society just like wizards, but literally subterranean. Not exactly unlike goblins to live underground and it ties in with the layout of Gringotts. What do you guys think? Any alternative ideas? Any similar thoughts?

And while we're at it, any thoughts about the rarely mentioned dwarves, hags, ghouls, and other things?

Edit: Also, what do goblins wear? Robes?Where are all the goblins?"
1,"The Deathly Hallows are made up of three magical items: the cloak, the wand, and the stone. When Dumbledore dies, he passed on three items to Hermione, Ron, and Harry: the book, the deluminator, and the snitch. The book has pages, which are flowy and flexible - like a cloak. The deluminator is a small handheld item that can produce light - like a wand. The snitch is a small round object - like a stone (and actually encases the Resurrection Stone). When the three protagonists talk of which Hallow they would choose, Hermione says the cloak, Ron says the wand, and Harry says the stone. Hermione is clever - like the third brother. Ron is a bit of a hot-head - like the first brother. Harry longs to be reunited with his dead family - like the second brother. Been through the books several times and only just realized this.Symbolism/Foreshadowing: DH"
1,"I learnt today that there was a real life Doris Crockford who wrote a story about a train, published in 1937.

The train, The Flying Scotsman, is based on a real life train (said to be the inspiration for the Hogwarts Express)

Every day the train would leave from platform 10, King’s Cross Station

And in Doris’s book the train goes on a magical adventure

(Remember the witch Harry meets in the Leaky Cauldron Book 1 who keeps going back to shake his hand? Her name? Doris Crockford)

[Article]( Crockford, in real life"
1,"So today is Remus Lupin’s birthday

He is one of me and a lot of Potter heads’ favourite character

And was that one character that successfully brought me back to Harry Potter fandom 

I remember liking Hermione back then when I first watched the PS movie when I was a kid

But after reading the PoA book again during quarantine, Remus got me back in

Here are the things I liked about him:
 - imo the best marauder
 - the best dada professor (Barty comes near, IMO not snape)

Extra:
 - his was one of the most tragic Harry Potter character

So what do you like about him and whyHappy Birthday Remus Lupin"
1,"Can't help but notice that JK Rowling hid some dirty jokes in the Goblet of Fire. 

Like in the first astrology class they're talking about planets and Ron asks: ""Can I see Uranus, Lavender?""

Or in the scene where Ollivander checks the wands and asks Cedric Diggory if he took good care of his wand and Diggory smirks and says something like: ""Just polished it last night.""

I really don't know what to make of these. Can't believe I haven't spotted them in previous reads but in all fairness I'm reading the German version and the jokes only really make sense when you translate them back to english.

Are there any more like that?Goblet of Fire dirty jokes"
1,"How many of you think that Harry was kinda selfish in naming the children after his relatives and friends , not giving Ginny an opinion ?"
1,"This isn’t another movie Ginny bashing thread (as it’s just a fact that it’s the writers’ fault). This is about how I’ve seen people say that Bonnie is not the drop dead gorgeous girl that fits the bill (followed by recs of other actresses which is fair), but I whole heartedly disagree. This was another case of those creating the movies making a mistake and in this case it is dialing her looks back using make up and more bland hair styles. Bonnie has done modeling and is incredibly attractive, but whoever made the decision to make her stand out less, screwed up bad. Especially since her hair isn’t flaming red which is fine but it’s another reason they needed to make her stand out more. I was just curious on other people’s thoughts when looking at it like this.

More proof of her being gorgeous:  Wright’s looks"
1,"I showed HP to a friend last night ... somehow she is 32 and loves fantasy but never had seen HP. Anyway! She had a good insight I never considered. The Dursleys wanted to put an end to the magic lines in their family tree, but their horrible treatment of Harry pretty much guaranteed that he would want to go to Hogwarts at the drop of a hat. I mean, if a half-giant broke into my house and started fires with his broom, I would probably be freaked the eff out. To even consider going with hagrid after his traumatizing entrance, Harry must have known that staying with the Dursleys would be worse than anything hagrid could do. If the Dursleys had spoiled Harry at all like they did Dudley, then Harry might have at least considered staying in a very cushy life with his aunt and uncle. And imagine if Dudley had gotten an owl — he probably would not have wanted to leave, or his parents could have at least brainwashed him easily to think magic folk are all freaks. But Harry had absolutely nothing keeping him there, so the Dursleys pretty much dug their own grave by treating him like an outcast.The Dursleys went about it all wrong"
1,"So me and my friend who hasn't read all the books where joking around on what the horcruxes could be, i.e Hogwarts, harry's wand, and my friend blurts out ""Harry is a horcrux!"" I low key just barely put on a straight face and said, ""ha ha wouldn't that be funny.""That one moment Spoilers for book 7"
1,"Albus Severus Potter, you were named after a man who raised me like a pig for slaughter and one who abused me for years just because I resembled my father, but it's okay because he wanted to bone my mum"
1,"The moon has tons of distinct and recognizable features that all seem to be completely missing form Lupins boggart.

And while lupin certainly must be aware of what the moon really looks like, what he actually fears is already captured in the moments before the moon becomes fully distinct.

Also seeing as he is afraid of the moon, he probably hasn't spent any more time than is possible to learn or appreciate its features. Neither are they really relevant to his fears.

So when it comes to the boggart, it becomes a generalize, indistinct pale white glowing orb.The reason why Lupins boggart wasn't recognizable to everybody else as the moon is probably because he's barely able to see it before transforming"
1,"Whenever Snape used it, it just made a cut, but when Harry used it, it cut everywhere on his body... Why?Why does sectumsempra act different?"
1,Why didn’t Sirius just put on one of moodys invisibility cloaks and take a walk around London? Like how did nobody think of this? Poor guy.Sirius escaping his second prison
1,"[You're a jerk, Mr. Weasley.]( don't know about anyone else but it's always really bugged me how in Goblet of Fire (the movie), when they first arrive at the Quidditch World Cup, Arthur holds open the tent door for everyone EXCEPT Harry."
1,My 9 year old has been really into Harry Potter books. She’s a huge Disney freak and we have a Disney trip planned this year. Should I grab her and do universal for a day? I’d be ditching my wife and two young muggles...Kid loves potter... thoughts on universal?
1,It is the only book where the Dursley’s take Harry to kings cross station. In the others he is usually away from their house.Fun fact about Philosophers stone
1,"Question for anyone that played the videogames (any version)!

The games never showed the Dursleys and only told they were ""Harry's awful family"" or there is a scene that I'm missing?

Thank you!Game Dursleys"
1,They were both Muggle-born and by the way Colin describes his family his dad wasn't a Squib or anything. Is there another example of two wizard siblings who were from a family of no magical blood?Isn't it kind of weird that Colin and Dennis both got into Hogwarts?
1,"Could the world's richest people actually be wizards in disguise using their magic to create fake money and using their ""companies"" as coverups ?"
1,"Seriously, Draco Malfoy literally hated Hermione Granger, there is no freaking way both would fall for each other, and quite frankly speaking, Draco Malfoy is a spoilt brat who just got a little pitiable towards the end. And again, he used the Avada Kadavara curse on Harry Potter in the bathroom in the Half Blood Prince, so my pity for him is limited.Dramione fanfics are idiotic"
1,"\*Probably a few do but most had their looks changed\*

I was thinking about the Snape doesn't look like THIS, he looks like THIS thread while reading the first book, and..

Vernon is swapped with Petunia/Dudley in the films. In the books, Vernon is dark haired, the other two blonde. In the movies, it's the reverse.

Hagrid's description: A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.

In the books, you can't see anything but his eyes of his face (at least at first). In the movies, you can actually see his face.

Hermione doesn't have buck teeth in the films.

Dumbledore doesn't look weak in the books. (This could've been solved by making a younger actor look old though).

Gilderoy Lockhart is suchahunk Ginny has a crush on him in the book. In the movies, he might be kinda handsome but he's certainly not THAT good-looking.

Umbridge in the book looks like a toad.

Cedric Diggory is supremely handsome in the books. (Sorry, Robert Pattinson, you've been cast as two super attractive dudes but neither time does your face actually look super hot).

Fleur in the books...looks like the human version of a cupcake. Super sweet. Tantalizing. There's even a drawing of her in the fourth book (and, spoiler alert, looks nothing like the actress).

That's NOT how I picture Tonks. Sorry, but...I like my version better (at the movies).

Bellatrix is not hot in the books. She looks tired and from her description, I gather she's rather plain looking but very bold. I LOVE Helena portraying her, but if we're getting technical, that's not how Bellatrix looks.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Far as I'm concerned, Draco, Harry, Ron, Luna, McGonagall, Arthur, and Molly probably all do look like they should.

Anyway, I feel all these actors did a splendid job even if their LOOKS didn't match their descriptions via book, their personalities are what matters. I just thought I'd point out, if you want to throw a dungbomb at Snape, you're going to have to throw one at The Others too.NONE of Them Look Like That"
1,"in the 7th book, why didn’t the gang just disapperate when the snatchers surrounded their tent in the forest after harry used voldemort’s name? they could have quickly bounced with the sword and hermione’s bag. i understand them being caught helped move the plot along, but i don’t know why they wouldn’t think to do it?SPOILERS: DH snatchers"
1,"Hello Everyone,

While I was searching for new books to read. I came across ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"". First I thought it was a fanfic (I never read any fanfic. Don't know what they are.). When I searched about it, apparently it was an actual Harry Potter book in the form of a skit/play.

It was written by 3 people:  J. K. Rowling, Jack Thorne, John Tiffany

I saw it had more than usual bad reviews (3.7 stars). Is it worth reading? should I Buy it? Will it have the J.K Rowling style?

Thanks,

Harry-James\_PotterHarry Potter and the Cursed Child"
1,"I always wondered how did Harry keep his invisibility cloak in his pocket the whole time, i mean isn’t it the same cloak that covered three teenagers until they were 15-16, it’s gotta be bigger than their school robes so how does it fit in his pocket the whole time. Does he tuck it in and leave the rest of the cloak sweeping behind him or what?How did harry keep his invisibility cloak in his pocket"
1,"...which is how he failed.

Which was the point of the books, that love is the most powerful thing in JK Rowling's view.

From the fact that Voldemort couldn't kill a baby because of love.

To the fact Bellatrix was in love with Voldemort and he neglected/overlooked her as insignificant.

To the fact that his ""most loyal servant"" loved the mother he murdered.

JK Rowling was trying to show that Snape LOVED Lily even after she died. And that is the point of why Voldemort failed.

Because of genuine, bona fide love. Love does not always motivate us to make the right choices. If it did, what a boring, easy, dare I say heavenly world it'd be? It'd be perfection. You meet someone, fall in genuine love, and that's it. Happily ever after. Case dismissed.

That is hardly most people's stories. Humans make the wrong choices. We lose people we genuinely care for. And sometimes maybe we do everything right and still lose them.

But if you think people are never genuinely in love (sometimes they aren't), you're missing the point JK Rowling was trying to show.

That even if you make the wrong choices, even if you lose someone you genuinely care for, even if it's your fault they died in the first place, they can be the one warm part in your heart.

Anyone whose child has died can attest to this: It's not obsession when someone you genuinely love died. Anyone who lost a beloved (nonabusive) spouse can also say such. They still feel his arms around them. REAL love never dies.

Even if Snape never kissed Lily, she was the brightest place in his dark heart. JK Rowling wanted the readers to know he loved her.

I for one think it's tragically beautiful when you love someone unconditionally. Most people don't. They only love someone as long as they're in their face.

Snape carried Lily around in his heart even though she married his bully, the person he hated the most. He loved her even though she never had any idea how he felt about her. Even though they never went on a date or shared a snog.

It was rare love. Not everyday.Voldemort Underestimated Love"
1,"I know I will be getting a lot of negative comments and maybe I amn't right at all points but, I don't think Dumbledore was biased with the houses.

The first book's housecup maybe the question but I really think the people deserved those points and I think Dumbledore also made Gryffindor win because he wanted to encourage them so I don't see any biasness there.

What do you think? I would love to hear your opinions too.Dumbledore wasn't biased; Unpopular opinion"
1,"Of (as far as Voldemort knew) his most loyal and useful followers, who was overall the more magically skilled?Who was the more powerful wizard: Barty Crouch....Jr or Snape?"
1,"Slughorn brewed a small cauldron and gave Harry a tiny vial. Where did the rest go? And for that matter, why didn't Dumbledore order a stockpile of that stuff in case a battle were to ever break out at Hogwarts? I know there are side effects of taking too much or too often, but once Voldy shows up outside the walls, give all the kids a shot and the teachers two.What happened to the rest of the Felix Felicis?"
1,"This has probably been bought up before but I’m kind of new to Reddit so here it goes. 

So this has always confused me, in the chamber of secrets when Harry is home for summer at the beginning of the book he keeps threatening Dudley that he’ll use magic on him as a way to keep Dudley away from him and scaring Vernon into leaving him alone but surely Petunia knows that he’s not allowed to use magic outside of school because Lily wouldn’t have been able to. So she knowingly just lets Harry terrorise her husband and son and that just doesn’t make sense to me.Using magic outside of Hogwarts"
1,"Gileroy: Questions, anyone? Comments?

Parvati: Wow! You must be so brave to have spent time with \*Shudders\* werewolves!

Harry: \*Mutters to Ron who snorts\* WoW! YoU mUsT bE sO bRaVe!

Gilderoy: Yes, every night they howled! Dreadful noise, ears up, howling at the moon.

Lavender: How did you not get bitten!?

Gilderoy: Every time one of them got near me, I sent a Stunner over and they dropped down. Vicious beasts, but smart, they got the message.

Hermione: \*Mutters to the Trio\* He does realize werewolves are very resistant to Stunners?

1,"Three aspects which baffle me:

1. Young Tom asks Slughorn about Horcruxes to gather more info about them. It wasn't Slughorn who introduced Tom to the concept. 

2. The memory clearly shows Slughorn abhorred the idea of creating 1 Horcrux, let alone 7.

3. The only slightly incriminating aspect is that he had detailed knowledge of the darkest of magic. But that's where it ends, it isn't criminal to have knowledge.

Tom was every teacher's favorite at Hogwarts bar Dumbledore. Slughorn's only fault here was being a bad judge of character, which can be ascribed to a lot of people.

Would love to get your thoughts on this.Why was Slughorn hesitant in sharing the horcrux memory with Dumbledore?"
1,"Real talk. People always be like if I could bring someone back to life, this is who it'd be. It's obviously Dobby/Hedwig. But let's get deeper. If you could kill off any character, who would it be? And don't go with an easy answer like Umbridge or death eater. Get juicy and pick someone people like"
1,"Hi everyone! I've been rewatching the movies these past few days and I sort of noticed during the scene in the death chamber where Harry and Sirius tag teamed Malfoy and another deatheater that Harry managed to disarm Lucius and Sirius disarmed him again before he sent him flying back? 

I'm confused. Was that a second wand or was it just his cane that Harry managed to disarm?

Anyways, I hope someone can answer my question. Thanks!!!Question: In OoTP movie, did Lucius have two wands or is the other one his cane?"
1,"Unsure if it was a movie adaptation but in GOF when Harry had the dream with voldy, wormtail and the old muggle man, the old man heard nagini hissing when she spoke to voldy. - if this is consistent with the book, why couldn't anyone hear the basilisk?Why could no one hear the hiss of the basilisk?"
1,"Beware, this is silly. But still, here it goes.

Tonks just arrived at the Burrow with Ron, after the mid-air encounter with death eaters. Remus asks what took them so long, and she answers:

""“Bellatrix,” said Tonks. “She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry, Remus, she triedvery  hard  to  kill  me.  I  just  wish  I’d  got  her,  I  owe  Bellatrix.  But  we  definitely  injured Rodolphus. . . . Then we got to Ron’s Auntie Muriel’s and we’d missed our Portkey and she wasfussing over us —”

And then, this is Remus' reaction: 

""*A muscle was jumping in Lupin’s jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to say anything else.*""

So, Lupin is tense. Definitely feeling... I'd say some supressed anger, mixed with relief. But, ""not being able to say anything else"" also speaks of pain. And emotion. As if everything that *could be said* would be emotionally unbearable. As if the pain'd be too much to handle.

I don't think I ever noticed that line. Maybe because I thought of his reaction as mainly preocupation and angst directed at Tonks, for being vulnerable to Bellatrix. And that's still what I think it is, but at the same time, Bellatrix killed Sirius. It definitely isn't a name without meaning to Remus: it has certain weight in his life, in his present. And, well, I'm a Wolfstar shipper since I first read PoA, but even if I wasn't, *Bellatrix killed Sirius*. His, at the very least, *only living friend*. And now, she tried to kill his *wife**.* 

So I don't think it's only fear of losing Tonks what Remus is feeling. He's thinking of Sirius, as well. Fear of losing her, in exactly the same way he lost  Sirius. Reliving the pain, the dispair, he felt when Sirius died. It's the threat of *also* losing Tonks to Bellatrix what causes that reaction, the jaw clenching in anger, his inability to say anything further.My Wolfstar-owned heart can't help but read too much into this sentence of TDH"

1,"I’ve been reading Harry Potter in Norwegian (second language) to practice, and I’m nearly done with the chamber of secrets.

Thing is, I’ve also been watching the movies with my family and I’m farther ahead in the movies. We’ve already watched the Order of Phoenix. At first I didn’t think much about it since I was basically only reading as a study method but as I’ve become more comfortable with the language I’m really getting to enjoy the book.

I now feel like I’ve spoiled it for myself, and kind of regret watching the movies first. My question is, should I try to catch up and hold off on watching the remaining movies until I’ve read their corresponding books first?Watch movies or catch up reading?"

1,Started reading Harry Potter first time today in life. Currently on the 1st book. Can anyone tell me did Hagrid knew the history of Snape and his love for Lily and hatred for James. As i read it says that Harry asked Hagrid why Snape hated him but Hagrid just seemed to change the topic.
1,"I'm currently reading the German translation of ""Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies"". In ""Chapter 3 - Sybill Trelawney"", when it comes to JK's thoughts, German translation says (and I can't re-translate literally, only what it says in German):

""[...] When Dolores Umbridge, a complete outsider who had never been educated at Hogwarts, tries to expel Sybill out of school [...]""

Eeeeeh - what? Dolores Umbridge has never been a Hogwarts student? That's news to me!

Does anyone of you have the original English version and can tell me how it is written there, please? I'm curious if it's a plot mistake or just a failed translation.

Also, in ""Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists"", it's clearly written that Umbridge is a Slytherin and graduated from Hogwarts.

If someone could clear up my confusion about this I would be very happy.

Thank you and lots of love!Plot mistake or lost in translation?"

1,"Hello All,  

I saw a post here yesterday about the classic ""Albus Severus"" line, and some more Snape-hate to go along with it. Whilst I agree the poor child has been given a horrible name, i just wanted to draw attention to Snape's role in this whole thing.  

I think Harry looks back at defeating Voldemort, which is probably the most important thing any wizard ever did, and realises three main components responsible are Himself, Dumbledore and Snape.  

Everyone is aware of the role of the first two, but people forget that Snape's role included being a high risk double agent, spending time with Voldemort (who killed Lily, that must have been tough), and maintaining this role even after his mentor/guide had passed.  

Not only did he conspire to kill Dumbledore and become part of his final plan, he also faked the sword, and presented the real one to the trio, exactly as instructed. He then desperately tryed to track down Harry at the last moment, to the point where he was killed by Voldemort. However, he still managed to pass on the critical information to Harry.  

I think it's easy to think of The Prince's Tale just being some soppy redemption of Snape due to his love for Lily, but the purpose of that chapter (and the purpose of Snape telling Harry), is to get the information to him that he has the Horcrux within himself, and he must sacrifice himself at the last moment.  

I only really appreciated this last night while listening. Snape was a very important piece of that final plan, allowing Dumbledore's plan to continue beyond his death, and using Snape's unique position in the game. Without Snape, it doesn't work out. Just something to consider.  

Granted he's still a dick. But it's not ""a free pass for being obsessed with Lily"".. it's a free pass for ""playing a hugely important role in defeating the most evil dark wizard of all time"".. pretty fair IMO.In Defence of Snape"

1,"In PoA, it’s mentioned that the last part of the DADA final involved facing a Boggart and fending it off by performing the Riddikulus Charm. When Hermione tried to face the Boggart, she ended up running away and crying bc she couldn’t stand up to it and found the fear overwhelming (the Boggart had taken the form of McGonagall telling her that she failed everything) and since the narration doesn’t mention anyone having any similar reactions, it can be assumed that Hermione was the only one not to tackle the Boggart successfully. And then I realized that Hermione was the only DADA student not to have practiced the Riddikulus Charm. Everyone save Harry and Hermione had already gotten a turn at facing a Boggart in Lupin’s first class and Harry had practice with a Dementor-Boggart during his Patronus lessons with Lupin so most of the class would’ve expectations of the form a Boggart would take in front of them and experience using Riddikulus to weaken it. Hermione, on the other hand wouldn’t be able to predict how a Boggart would appear in front of her if she saw one and she wouldn’t have the experience of using the Riddikulus Charm; even if she understood the theory of using the Charm, it’s a different story practicing it in a real life situation and since Boggarts aren’t exactly walking around everyone it’s not like Hermione could practice the charm if she wanted to. So in a way, Lupin excluding Hermione from the Boggart lesson ended up impacting her gradeProfessor Lupin unintentionally ended up screwing Hermione’s final DADA exam"

Hey everyone! Today I want to talk about wand cores and why I think that Garrick Ollivander's wands are NOT the absolute best and why I feel the characters in Harry Potter only believe so out of bias. And that's where I'm going to start:

Garrick Ollivander is the best wandmaker in the UK, however that does NOT mean he's the best in the world. Why does everyone say he is? Out of cultural bias of course, his family name is famous in the UK and Ireland and he's credited with the creation of the term ""Supreme Wand Cores"", being Dragon heartstring, Unicorn hair and Phoenix feather, which makes him standout from among his fellow wandmakers in the UK, however we see first hand that Viktor Krum when he says: ""I was one of the last to purchase a Gregorovitch wand. They are the best although I know, of course, that you Britons set much store by Ollivander."", this shows that Krum, and likely other people in Eastern Europe feel that Gregorovitch's wands are the best in the world, and I'd bet money that American wizards and witches would say the same about American wandmakers and so on. So why do all the characters we love in Harry Potter say Ollivander is the best? Out of cultural bias, pure and simple. 

Now, I want to address Garrick's ""Supreme Wand Cores"" and why I feel they aren't truly the best or strongest cores. I think he chose these three because they were the most balanced, and would therefor cause the least dissatisfied customers. I feel he chose this method because it was best for business, if the wands are easily tamed, less wizards and witches would come back to his shop with complaints, and thus his reputation would remain in good standing. While this makes sense and IS good business practice, I want to examine a few wands with cores we know to be at least as good as the ""Supreme Cores"", and in many cases, vastly superior. 

\#1: The Elder Wand, this wand has a Thestral tail hair core and as we know, is the most powerful wand in existence. While the rumors of it being made by Death are cute, it's MUCH more likely to have been made by  Antioch Peverell and the power it possesses would seem to indicate that Thestral tail hairs are much more powerful than the ""Three Supreme Cores"". 

\#2: Salazar Slytherin's Wand, this wand had a Basilisk horn core and was crafted by Salazar himself, it was stated by Gormlaith Gaunt, a former wielder of the wand, to have been more powerful than the one she got from Ollivander's which had a Dragon heartstring core. Additionally, this wand could be instructed to ""sleep"" when spoken too in Parseltongue, giving this core strategic advantages to those who could speak it. 

\#3: Fleur Delacour's Wand, this wand had a Veela hair core and was crafted by a French wandmaker, likely for Fleur specifically as the hair came from her grandmother, the use of this core shocked Garrick when examining the wand, who believes that Veela hair wands are too temperamental. We know Fleur is a capable witch and has performed impressive feats of magic with this wand, comparable to anything done with Garrick's own ""Supreme Core"" wands, showing it's at least equal. 

\#4: Webster &amp; Chadwick Boot's Wands, these wands had Horned Serpent horn cores and were stated by Isolt Sayre, who wielded Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk wand, to have been of exceptional power. Chadwick was able to use his wand to duel against Gormlaith Gaunt who was much more powerful than he was and far more experienced to a draw, forcing Gormlaith to complement his power. This is a true testament to the wand's core, which was amplified 10x when used with Webster's wand, which was it's twin. Like the Basilisk core wands, these wands could be spoken too in Parseltongue, instead alerted their owners when they were in danger when they heard the ancient language. 

\#5: Seraphina Picquery's Wand, this wand was crafted by Violetta Beauvais, an American wandmaker, it had a Rougarou hair core. While we haven't seen this wand in action, we know it belonged to the President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America, and it's unlikely she'd be capable of achieving the power necessary for this position with a wand of low quality. Implying this wand is very powerful, again being at LEAST on par with anything from Garrick. 

Looking at all this info, it would seem safe to believe that the power of a wand core comes directly from how powerful the creature it was taken from, a belief that is further backed up by Garrick's comments on weak cores such as Troll whiskers and Kneazle hair. Since Thunderbirds are relatives to the Phoenix, and equally powerful in their own way, we can assume Thunderbird tail feather cores would be comparably powerful. Nundu mane quills would also likely produce massively powerful wands, since they're said to be even more dangerous than Dragons. 

What do you all think? Discuss!Wand Cores"
1,"I was just surfing the net and randomly looked up the Harry Potter Film Series and found this. From The Philosopher's Stone; to The Prisoner of Azkaban , all the films are rated PG. But from The Goblet of Fire onwards, they are rated a 12. Why do you think that might be? The reasons that I can find are:

* Voldemort's Return.
* People start dying (but wait--didn't Quirrel and Riddle die?).
* Because it started getting scarier (but wait--wasn't the Voldemort-drinking-unicord-blood scene quite creepy... and what about the Basilisk whispering about blood and death through the walls?)
* Because the movies took a darker turn (well--because of Voldemort).

Well what do you guys think. After GOF, the PEGI ratings become a 12. Any other reasons why it could be?Voldemort's Impact on PEGI Ratings."
1,"Fun fact: in the first book it wasnt hermione that asked ""nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless"" it was seamus finniganFun fact"
1,"So yeah just wondering, since obviously Dumbledore didn't practice the dark arts in the way that Voldemort did, but seeing as Dumbledore is one of the greatest wizards to ever live, do you think he could have if he wanted to?Could Dumbledore have used dark magic at the same level as Voldemort if he wished to?"
1,"Imagine a series with a season or so. Each Season, or maybe even each episode, would adapt a different short story or long form synopsis set during different eras of the Wizarding World.

IE one season could be about the First Wizarding War, recasting Dumbledore, Lily, James, Snape etc of course.

Then you could have a season about the Marauders

Or you could have an episode about the tale of Isolt Sayre

Or an episode adapted from one of the Bard stories

You could even do one about the Three Brothers and take ""Grimms Fairy Tale"" like approach to it, something akin to Del Toro's work, or narrated by Dumbledore, perhaps; maybe this could be an animated short

Each could be directed by a different director so as to have a distinct style and feel, and despite being set in the same universe, would be distinct from the Harry Potter saga.

Essentially, rebooting the Wizarding World, and opening the lore of the world live, for a new generation and new audiences. I think most casual people aren't really aware of just how big the world Rowling created is, and think it's only limited to Harry/Voldy/Grindlewald. There's a lot of stories to potentially mine.Would you support a Wizarding World themed limited series of 1-2 seasons?"
1,"I'm going to preface this saying 4:20 is a great time for Harry Potter. In the second trial, Daniel has a brace on his left leg, is that referencing to when (in the books) Harry is sure he fractures something in his leg after Moody puts him under the imperius curse in the books during class. I could be way off base but I thought it was a cool easter egg. Thoughts?Movie Easter Egg to Books"
1,"For a long time, I've been of the belief that the house system in Harry Potter is a really bad idea. Imagine you're going into sixth grade. Before you can start classes, your teacher tells you you have to be in a category that are essentially boiled down to good, evil, friendly, and smart. And you don't even get to decide! A hundred-year-old piece of headware that introduces itself through song is going to decide what box you fit in for the next seven years. That wouldn't fly, right?

I think it would've been a lot more interesting if the houses were academic courses. For example, Ravenclaws get advanced classes and much more in-depth coursework. Slytherins can choose electives and drop core classes earlier than the other houses in order to pursue their ambition. I'm not sure about Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs, but maybe Hufflepuffs have less coursework in favor of getting involved in the community (joining clubs, quidditch, volunteer work, etc.) and Gryffindors have a DADA/Auror/curse-breaking focus. For the first year, students don't have a house and are able to get to know each other without house lines dividing them. At the end of the year they decide on a house depending on what they want to get out of their Hogwarts experience.

It just always rubbed me the wrong way the way the house system functioned. Imagine you get sorted into Slytherin after hearing your whole life that they're the evil house and that only dark wizards are sorted there? That would be devastating to an eleven-year-old.

What do you think of the house system? If you don't like it, what would you replace it with?Opinions on the house system and alternatives"

1,"Theory: Teddy Lupin was not born a werewolf because the metamorphmagus genes were stronger. Or potentially, the morphing is strong enough to keep him in his current form so he couldn’t turn. Lupin could not have had a non-wolf child with anyone but Tonks."
1,"Voldemort, to me, and I'm sure it was the intent, is the equivalent of Wizard Hitler. Hitler, for all his evil, was incredibly charming, for those of his times, he was likable, even. Before the War, and before the  the Genocides became public, he was even Time's Man of the Year. He was celebrated even in America, by non-Nazis, as Germany's potential hero, who would raise her to greatness again. As we saw, he brought her to utter degradation, degeneracy and ruin. Yet, he was compelling. He spoke eloquently, in a manner that many real life people felt themselves almost bewitched by his speech.  


I say all these things because if you examine how a man as morally repulsive as Hitler could gain so many followers, you can see the qualities necessary for a Wizard like Voldemort to gain so many followers as well. Voldemort, when I read him, is highly intelligent, cold, calculating, menacing, charismatic...Yet as utterly inhuman as any serial killer in any prison. Lacking in feeling, which only added to his menace; we are dealing with someone amazing, who has transcended humanity in both mentality and form - and yet in the process has become grotesque. Someone who could've been truly GREAT - Among the greatest of all time, as Hitler, had he been a good man, could've been one of the great men of history. There is a nuance to Voldemort that makes it plain why one would follow him, if they agreed with his views. 

Movie Voldemort on the other hand comes off a clown. A cartoon villain. A cackling, goofy sort of maniacal metaphorical mustache twirling madman. And yes, book Voldemort is insane, but it is a cold, cruel, empty hollowed out insanity, the insanity of one who has literally experimented too much, who has been shaped by evil into something past humanity, or some very distorted mockery of it. The Voldemort of the movies is almost laughable. How can one be reasonably frightened of someone that is a buffoon? There's nothing remotely likable or scary about him; Movie Voldemort does not sell me as a man who could enslave the minds of so many strong willed people and bend them to his own will. One could argue that Lucius Malfoy, in the films, has a much more menacing presence. Yet, I can't see Malfoy serving movie Voldemort and being able to take him seriously. I can't see Snape doing so in his youth either. On rewatches, movie Voldemort tends to remind me of Count Olaf from the Snickett books; more a pitiable, buffoonish wretch than a true VILLAIN, a true master of evil. Voldemort to me is Dumbledore's dark double - For as noble and as great as Dumbledore is, Voldemort is the ugliest personification of what Dumbledore would be if he dabbled in evil - and should as such carry the same grace, just darkened; the same nobility, just without any warmth; the same eloquence, just without any humanity.  


Yet instead we have a man who makes faces, waves his arms dramatically and cartoonishly, and laughs in the most bizarre and laughable way.Anyone else feel very let down by movie Voldemort?"
1,why...WHY was Cate Blanchett not cast as Fleur’s mom in HP and the Deathly Hallows? She would have been so sexy and powerful in that role. I know that she only had 0.2 seconds of screen time...but she should have AT LEAST made an appearance.Cate Blanchett should have played Apolline Delacour in HP
1,"Can we just take a moment to appreciate how this ma'am is the reason everyone is alive. Well yes she did tell Dumbledore the prophecy while Snape was eavesdropping, and Snape told Voldy which set this whole in motion. But i mean we wold have had a heck of a book\\movies series had it not been for her. Happy Birthday, Sybil!Happy Birthday Professor Trelawney!!!!"
1,"This is probably my most controversial opinion I have with Harry Potter, to many people this movie is usually ranked pretty high but to ME this movie is a fucking shit show. Goblet of fire movie did remove alot of stuff from the book which annoyed me to death but whats worse is the fact that this movie ruined stuff from the books which imo is worse and I despise it for it there's alot of reasons why I hate this one but I can never put it all in one post so I am going to go over the major flaws and that explains why my score for this movie is very low

[

[

there's my other reviews for the other movies if you're interested back to the movie

&amp;#x200B;

1. **HARRY AND THE DURSLEYS**

The dursleys are horrible we can all agree on that right? I am mainly going to focus on Dudley so our movie starts off fucking horrible. In the books it was harry making fun of Dudley which felt amazing but in the movie for some reason its Dudley and his gang making fun of harry honestly its so dumb why they even cut this out. Harry was tormented by Dudley for like 10 years of his childhood and to have him finally truly stand up to him is such an amazing moment for harry. The movies have this weird obsession of ruining ever character for some reason and harry is ruined hard in this movie. Then we the dementors show up and this annoys me so much, the fact that harry's patronus is not even a fucking stag omfg the movie just started and it already failed this bad. And they forget to say who sent the dementors and cut out the owls being sent which was hilarious in the books. Bad start movie, bad start

2. **NUMBER 12 GRIMMAULD PLACE**

Weirdly enough this is like the 3rd house we see in the entire series. Anyway Grimmauld place is probably one of the best locations in the place because we practically spend so little time their and already know so much about the place, like everyone can remember Mrs Black's screaming portrait or the troll leg umbrella stand that Tonks keeps knocking... oh wait all of this stuff I mentioned is cut out from the film. And who can forget the cleaning, only a series like Harry Potter can make fucking cleaning fun as hell and I can't believe they cut that out too honestly whats wrong with this movie. Now probably my favourite thing that happens in this place is that amazing incredible boggart scene with Molly and harry see's all her children dead and not just her children even a dead harry. That is fucking beautiful and it basically solidifies that harry is an unofficial Weasley and its done in such an amazing way by not just saying that he's one but showing it in a heartbreaking way and I love it for doing that and I hate that they cut this out. They also forgot Ron and Hermione being prefects.

**3. THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC**

I love the fact that this is the first time we actually see the ministry and it makes for an awesome reveal. I don't really get that sense of awe and spectacle in the film mainly due to the fact we don't see all of floors. Like I said with grimmauld place we practically live at the ministry its described so well in the books that it just sticks with you like I can name you like 4 floors at the top of my head rn. But before since I watched the movies first I never really cared about the ministry that much at all and its just skimmed over. We just see the atrium and then BOOM we're already at the hearing but in the books we see so many floors and places that I can't help but love it. Now the actual hearing, the fact this entire hearing was done bcz harry did magic outside of school is lost once you realised that in the movies they do magic outside of school so many times and it just seems comical in the books they bring up the fact that harry ''did'' magic in the chamber of secrets but he says it was dobby and fudge doesn't believe none of it. And Dumbledore ignoring isn't really shown that much yk in the books its made apparent that the entire time Dumbledore didn't even look at him or show any sign that he knew harry even existed but in the movie he just kinda shouts his name quietly and then he just doesn't care afterwards, which is stupid af.

**4. PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE**

Umbridge is horrible, we can all agree on that... BUT, in the movies her actions don't really seem that bad beside the fact that she carved words on harry's hand which is horrible but compared to her actions in the books she's pretty tame actually. She doesn't ban him from quidditch, she doesn't give him multiple detentions, she doesn't put Hagrid on probation and doesn't ban harry from hogsmeade. In the books harry wanted to basically leave Hogwarts, she makes his life hell at Hogwarts. And her appearance is not even close to how she was described in the books. I once showed a picture of how umbridge looked like in the books in a discord chat and everyone was fucking disgusted and I don't think people were disgusted when they saw how she was in the movie no offence to actor she played her fine but its mainly the fact that she's not as despicable as she was in the books. Oh yeah and the quibbler thing with was amazing and I hate the they cut it out and where's Firenze that was funny, the fact that Dumbledore hired a teacher just to annoy umbridge is incredible.

**5. DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY**

The fact that a huge part of this book was just butchered down into into a montage and half a class is horrible. This shit was fun as hell in the books, seeing the kids rebelling against umbridge and the entire ministry is amazing I loved it so much. And neville finding the room of requirement by accident is fucking dumb af and how does Hermione even know about the room in the first place? you siriusly telling me that Hermione knows what this room does and doesn't know where its at, EVEN THOUGH DUMBLEDORE TOLD HARRY LAST YEAR bruh just bruh. Where the coins at? those shit were the best and its used in the later books, Draco using it in book 6 and neville using it to call people in the battle of Hogwarts and its like why cut this out the books came out before the movie came out so its even more stupider. And Dobby, thats all I have to say,

**6. St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries**

*Neville’s mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress. She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in Moody’s old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix. Her face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge, and her hair, which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made timid motions toward Neville, holding something in her outstretched hand.*

*“Again?” said Mrs. Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. “Very well, Alice dear, very well — Neville, take it, whatever it is. . . .”*

*But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his mother dropped an empty Droobles Blowing Gum wrapper.*

*“Very nice, dear,” said Neville’s grandmother in a falsely cheery*

*voice, patting his mother on the shoulder. But Neville said quietly, “Thanks Mum.”*

*His mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself. Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he’d ever found any- thing less funny in his life.*

Thats all I have to say, They cut out this incredible scene and I will never forgive them for cutting this out.

**7. Snape's Worst Memory**

Damn what an amazning chapter. Occulmency is so much fun like reading I fucking love it so much, its like watching a film reel I in a book, but in the movies it just happens so quickly and fast and they just use it as an excuse to reuse old footage from the other movies for nostalgic purposes, and thats annoying in the books we mostly see stuff we never knew before. Snape in the books was cruel in these lessons and not encouraging enough but in the movies he doesn't really do much. For example when harry see's his memory, in the books he throws a jar of dead crockroaches, in the movie Snape just tells him to get out. Now the actual scene in fucking stupid in the movies, thats not even what protego does and the pensive isn't even fucking there, its so fascinating to see what Hogwarts was like back then and see what the marauders were like but in the film we just see them hanging Snape and thats it. There's a deleted scene not really scene, which shows lily with them but for some reason they cut it out. They forget the most important part, there's a reason this is called Snape's worst memory he called his best friend a mud blood and regretted his entire life. 

**8. O.W.L.s**

Oh my god. The movie mentions this and tell us how important this is, AND THE DON'T EVEN SHOW IT.  Even in the HBP movie mcgonnagoll mentions that harry wants to become an auror BUT HE NEVER EVEN HAD HIS CARRER ADVICE WTF. And now the actual exams, only a series like Harry Potter could make exams fun. Its weird to say but I love reading the exams and all the kids being stressed and its so fascinating to see how wizards do their exams, But the movies just doesn't really care about Hogwarts being a school. Look how many classes are in these movies, Barely any. And where tf is Hagrid hulk smashing umbridge and her ministry cronies? that shit was phenomenal I loved that so much and then mcgonnagoll gets four stunning spells to the chest, and they cut it all out. Istg this movie is falling apart, OOTP isn't even my favourite book in the series, but it has some of the best scenes in the series. When harry passes out from seeing the false memory why... WHY is it that Hermione is the who comes to him? Why Hermione only wtf. These movies ship Hermione and harry so much I can't even, thats a story for another day. Now all of the shit I just said, Has nothing compared to whats next. 

**9. THE DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES** 

This. This right here is the biggest reason I hate and despise this fucking movie. This movie ruined the best fight scene in all of Harry Potter and I will not stand for it. Before I get into the fight I wanna talk about something else, Kreacher. Why does harry or anyone else get the fucking idea to contact Kreacher. He's in grimmauld place and they did it in the books, And the fact that he betrayed Sirius is heartbreaking and the worst part is, he told all of this to Dumbledore while laughing. And why is harry like ''I'm doing this alone bye bye'' right before they were about to leave? JUST LEAVE UMRBIDGE ISN'T HERE YOU'RE BASICALLY GIVING HER TIME TO CATCH YOU BOZOS! okay lets just get into the actual fight. They go into the ministry go to level 9 (see what I did there? ;D) and here's where the problems lie. Where the actual Frick is the entrance to the department of mysteries? the entrance itself was part of the place and its not even there wtf, they just walk into a lift and boom they're in the prophecy room. Now here is where my problems lie, IMO this is the greatest fight scene in all of HP. Usually in fights its basically like just duels like 2 homeboys using expelliarmus or something and that is Kinda annoying. The spells can be the same but the place doesn't need to be, having this fight in the department makes it so anything can fucking happen, because the logic allows for it. You wanna have a jar of brains that strangle you? fuck it go ahead. The department is full so much weirdo shit and I fucking love that, this fight scene is what makes this book a masterpiece. now lets look at the movie... OMFG THEY JUST FUCKING CUT OUT ALMOST ALL OF THE FUCKING ROOMS! WTF MOVIE YOU HAD ONE JOB IDFC WHAT EXCUSE THEY HAD IF THEY COULDN'T DO IT RIGHT THEN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT AT ALL! YOU CUT OUT THE BRAINS, THE TIME ROOM, THE SPACE ROOM, THE ENTRANCE, THE WEIRDO ROOM THAT NOBODY CAN OPEN. BUT YOU KEEP THE PROPHECY ROOM AND THE DEATH CHAMBER? WHY! YOU COULD'VE MADE ONE OF THE BEST FIGHTS IN ALL OF HP HISTORY BUT NO! YOU JUST HAD TO CUT OUT EVERYTHING DIDN'T YOU! NOW LETS GET INTO THE ACTUAL FIGHT. IN THE BOOKS THERE'S A FUCKING BABY HEADED DEATH EATER WALKING AROUND, DOLOHOV USES SOME KIND OF PURPLE FLAME THINGY, HERMIONE SILENCES THIS DUDE, NEVILLE GET HIS NOSE BROKEN AND JABS HIS WAND INTO DEATH EATER'S EYES, RON GETS STRANGLED BY BRAINS! HOW COOL DOES THAT SOUND THE MOVIE JUST FUCKING CUT OUT EVERYTHING THAT I JUST SAID. ITS STUPID, ITS A DISGRACE, ITS HORRIBLE! LOOK AT HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOI LOOK! THATS JUST THE FIGHT ITSELF LETS TALK ABOUT THE REASON EVERYONE IS EVEN FUCKING THERE! THE PROPHECY! THEY MAKE HARRY HEAR THE DAMN PROPHECY BEFORE HE GOES INTO DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE WHAT THE FUCK! IN THE BOOKS IT GETS DESTROYED BY NEVILLE'S DANCING LEGS WHICH IS HILARIOUS! NEVILLE BROKE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN THE ENTIRE SERIES FROM HIS LEGS LMFAO. BUT IN THE MOVIES SIRIUS JUST PUNCHES LUCIUS AND DROPS THE DAMN THING BRUH! NOW LETS TALK ABOUT SIRIUS'S DEATH WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL! THE FACT THAT HE JUST FALLS THROUGH THE VEIL IS HEARTBREAKING AND HARRY THINKING HE WILL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE, BUT LUPIN TELLS HIM THE TRUTH, HE ISN'T COMING BACK AND HE NEVER DOES. HARRY KEEPS SHOUTING SIRIUS AT THE VEIL THINKING HIS GODFATHER WILL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE SMILING AT HIM BUT NO, HE DOESN'T COME BACK. THE MOVIE SAYS FUCK THAT SHIT AND HAS HIM DIE FROM THE AVADA KEDAVRA SO THE VEIL DIDN'T KILL HIM IN THE MOVIES IT WAS THE KILLING CURSE WTF AND HARRY SEE GET HIT BY IT SO WHY WOULD HE THINK HE'LL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE? OH YEAH BECAUSE HE DOESN'T THINK THAT! THIS MOVIE TOOK EVERYTHING THAT MADE OOTP SO AMAZING AND UNIQUE AND JUST THREW IT OUT THE FUCKING WINDOW. WHY IS IT THAT IN THE MOVIE ITS BELLATRIX TAUNTING HARRY BUT IN THE BOOKS ITS HARRY TAUNTING BELLATRIX TO THE POINT WHERE SHE'S ACTUALLY SCARED WTF!.

1,"Like when I first read of them together I was super confused. At first I figured it was probably because when I read this it was after a year of a break because I was mourning Sirius. Yes, I know I'm too emotionally attached to him. But I figured that maybe I just forgot anything that might be showing that they liked each other. Haha nope it just kinda happens in Half Blood Prince and I have no idea why. Honestly not even sure if Remus liked her because damn she does a lot of ""I love you why won't you just date me"" lowkey manipulative stuff to him. I think he just felt bad and eventually went out with her just to get her to stop bringing it up at every moment no matter how inappropriate. It just sucks because I like both of the characters a lot but it feels like they ended up together just because Joanne wanted to match some characters up and went ""ok the 38 year old man currently mourning the loss of his best friend and said best friend's cousin that's like 13 years younger than him sounds good"" without putting much thought into how they are together. Although as a wolfstar shipper (had these thoughts far before I started shipping Remus and Sirius by the way. This isn't a ""but my ship is better"" post) I do like the ""wow your boyfriend dies so you marry his cousin"" jokes.Did anyone else think Tonks and Lupin came out of nowhere?"
1,"Hey guys, I know that this is a bit of a crazy theory but I just realized that Tom Riddle might be Voldemort. For starters, Dumbledore sometimes called Voldemort “Tom” which could be referring to Tom Riddle. Also, last night I rearranged the letters in Tom Riddle’s full name, Tom Marvolo Riddle, and it created, “I am Lord Voldemort”. 

This might be a bit of a stretch but let me know what you guys think!Fan Theory: Tom Riddle is Voldemort"
1,thought that was an interesting insight.The death of Hedwig and the loss of the Firebolt symbolize the end of Harry’s childhood as he comes of age.
1,"Is mad eye the only person who actually knows what a boggart looks like?   

Lupin points out that no one knows what a boggart really looks like because it always assumes the form of what the person fears the most.  

In order there is a boggart in the upstairs drawing room. Molly has mad eye use his eye to look into the cabinet before they go and deal with it. He confirms it is in fact a boggart.  But it wouldn’t have assumed a new shape (because mad eye is a bad ass who fears nothing!).  

Surely someone else would have been able to see a boggart in a non shape shifted form before, otherwise how he would he identify it as a boggart. 

Ah well, those were my thoughts as I was falling asleep last night listening to Jim dale tell me my favorite bedtime story.Re-listening to order of Phoenix and had a thought"
1,"im having trouble making an account. My friend showed me the website, and when I try to enter my birthdate (9/1/2001) it won't let me hit the ""Join Now"" button. Pls internet, help me.HELP ME"
1,"\- ""Light Drama"" based around the founding and founders of Hogwarts. The rift between Slytherin and the others would be the main point of conflict.

\- The Marauders, Lilly, Snape, etc at Hogwarts.

\- The formation of the Order and the first fight against Voldemort

\-Set right after the fall of Voldemort, a crime/detective movie with Mad-Eye as the main character. Set around him tracking down/prosecuting old Death Eaters.

\-A ""comeback kids"" sports movie about a struggling Quidditch club that comes out of nowhere to win the league. Chudley Cannons would be a fun team to base it on. Ron's favorite and a team that has been known to struggle

\-Since we don't see or hear about him much, a movie based on Charlie Weasley's adventures in Romania. Would be cool to see different kinds of dragons. Thought it could be set in the summer time and have Hagrid join him/help him for the break. That way the fans can still see a beloved character in this new setting/story.

\-After JK released the names and locations of the different wizarding schools, would be cool to see a movie set in one of the ""foreign"" schools.

\-This one is a stretch haha: Based on Bill Weasley, a financial/Wall Street type thriller about the relationship between goblins and wizards.

Curious if anyone else does this, if so what are your ideas! Thanks for letting me post my nonsense!My friends and I like to brainstorm ideas for movies within the Harry Potter universe for fun. Here are some of my favorite:"
1,Hey so for my extended essay I'm going to be analyzing the duplicity in Snape and comparing it with the duplicity in another character... Do you guys think there is sufficient information in the books about Snape's duplicity? My thoughts are kinda all over the place. Could you guys explain Snape's duplicity because I've always thought that he was on Dumbledore's side but I've been reading other analyzations and people say that Snape was not completely on Dumbledore's side at the same time. Which books have the most info on this? Thanks so muchAnalyzing Snape for my extended essay..
1,"In the 2020/2021 climate, I’m guessing a diverse cast would be the biggest change. They’d probably have Dumbledore be black and would’ve had to include a gay character.

PLEASE NOTE I’m not hating on this concept. Just suggesting that this is how it could’ve been if it was released today.

What do y’all think?What are some differences do you think the HP movies would have if they were released today?"
1,"I know the main characters are in Gryffindor, but it would be nice to see more people from each house. Especially people from Slytherin, to emphasize the fact the everyone in that house is not just evil or rude, even though they are often portrayed that way in the movies. I also really want to see Quidditch matches between different houses, and maybe even see a different house win the house cup. I think it would expand the characters and give more detail to Hogwarts.Why do we not see more houses in the movies."
1,"I was really hoping for kind of a bear. That’s what I always said when people asked. Felt like it fit pretty well. I just joined the Wizarding World Harry Potter fan club, took the test and they gave me a weasel. As least I’m a Gryffindor and at least my wand is cool. Vine wood, 11 3/4 inches with unicorn hair core. What’s your patronus animal and wand build?Just found out my patronus is a Stoat. That’s a kind of weasel. What’s yours?"
1,I don’t know if this question has been brought up before but do you think students at hogwarts could change houses if they did not fit into the one the sorting hat put them in?Hogwarts Houses

Harry: Hermione your cat ate Ron's rat

Hermione: From my point of view he didn't do it!

Harry: Then Ron and i don't deserve your friendship!

*From my point of view Revenge of the Sith is Star Wars 6 and not Star Wars 3A parody of the ""From my point of view"" scene from Star Wars 6* (2005) set during The Prisoner of Azkaban"
1,"I mean, in the books, this was a super rare power that only Voldemort and Snape could do, and even Kingsley was shocked when he saw Voldemort flying. In the movies it's just like yeah you can fly and you can fly, but you'll use brooms in the chase scene because action.Anybody else hate how the movie directors made all the Death Eaters able to fly?"
1,"I was recently watching the Half-Blood Prince and I saw that there was a sort of green tint to the whole thing. This makes sense, because a big part of the plot is Snape’s development as a character. Snape is a Slytherin. Slytherin’s colors are *green* and silver. Also, Snape taught Potions. Potions have sort of a green color, typically. 

Is this just me or am I actually correct about some thing for once?Has anyone noticed this?"
1,The books seemed to be aimed towards middle school and high school students. I've (20m) never had the privilege of reading them when I was younger. Would you think the books will leave an impact for a twenty something reading them for the first time?Would you think harry potter would be a meaningful read for a college student?
1,"Not sure if this makes sense but last night I was thinking about Slughorn memories. 

IIRC when explaining the pensieve Dumbledore tells Harry that he takes out memories and places it in the pensieve. Which implies that once you've taken the memories out, they don't swarm around in your head anymore. 

But if that is the case, how would it work with Slughorns memory? He has already given ""his copy"" of the memory that he has altered. So did he produce a fake memory or did he copy his memory and alter it? 

And on another note: how fucking cool is it, that Wizards can alter a memory like with a Photoshop for memories? And can anyone alter their memory or only powerful Wizards? 

TL;DR can Wizards CTRL+C and CTRL+V with their memories?Regarding Slughorns Memory: can Wizards make copies of their memories?"
1,"I wanted to ask your opinion on Harry Potter and Cursed Child I'm interested because I've already read it and it's fine for me.

1,"I have been rereading the books and it makes me so curious as to who takes care of all the other necessary things needed in the Wizarding world. I have not read Pottermore or done any extensive research. I did how try googling variations of my question though

In the 5th book they talk about all of these fantastic careers and even the jobs you see revolve around a limited set of jobs (ministry, hospital, shops, bank).

Who grows produces the food like meat and produce?
Who collects the raw materials for potions or even everyday things like houses or clothing?
Who helps settle disagreements between wizards as there seem to be no lawyers?
Who are the manufacturers for cauldrons, books, household items? 
Who breeds owls, frogs and cats? 

I'm sure I'm missing so many more things. Please let me know if other less flashy jobs are explained that I didn't mention.Who does all of the other regular jobs that would keep the Wizarding world running and where do you learn how to do them?"

It's been quite some time since I read this one and since I saw the movies. And let me tell you, it's quite different that the first or the second, or even the third time.
I'm past my teenage years and i feel like my pov has changed quit a lot. My opinion on Harry and his outbursts, Hermione, Sirius and Dumbledore, I view them very differently. But, what hasn't changed is my hatred for Umbridge. If possible, it's even bigger.

Every time she appears I get so angry I have to stop reading. I dislike her to the point I wished Voldemort invaded Hogwarts and tortured her.

1,"I suppose this might be long, as I am prone to rambling occasionally. I just wanted to warn everyone ahead of time.

I am definitely out of the age bracket for an ordinary first-time Harry Potter reader. I was 24 when the first book was released.
I had a stepson who was a little too young for Harry Potter at the time. By the time he was old enough, he had other interests. I knew for certain that this was something I would have obsessed over had it come out when I was young. Fast forward to 2018. I don't know why, but I decided that this was as good a time as any to step into the world of Hogwarts. I listened to all the books on Audible during my commute to and from work. It was, no pun intended, magical. I would get a light feeling in my stomach and I couldn't wait to hear what was next. When I was about 10 years old, my mother and I were at a yard sale and I found a box full of old D&amp;D books. I bought them and was hooked instantly. That was the last time I felt as giddy as I did by listening to the Harry Potter books. 

Over time, both real-time and book time, something changed. These precocious children were getting older, and I noticed that my patience for them was thinning. I'm certain that had I started the books as a young man, then I would have felt differently. I was not reading them as a young man, though. I was reading them as an adult with a family of my own. The fact of the matter is, as the children got older, I grew less fond of them. Here they were, wizards and witches, living in a world of wonder, and all they seemed to do was whine and complain.

I listened to all the books even though as they went on it felt more like a chore than a pleasure. I was hoping for an incredible rush of emotion at the end, but that didn't happen for me. I felt that the pacing was rushed later in the story, and perhaps Rowling was just trying to finish the thing and put it behind her. It was a shame because the early books were so amazing.

Now here we are today. I still look in on what is happening in the online world of Harry Potter. I like to see what people are thinking and reading all the fan theories. I still enjoy Harry Potter, in fact, I am watching the first movie as I type this. I still have only seen the first two movies. I still get a little tingle in my belly thinking about how I felt reading the first few books. I even ordered a custom wand and everything. I still can't wait to go to Hogwarts on a vacation sometime, even though I will have to settle for the Orlando version. 

If you're still reading this, thank you. Thank you for letting an old man pour out the feelings he has for a series of books that he is too old for. I think I will continue reading and watching Harry Potter, I just might stop when the children are of a certain age.What Harry Potter meant to me, a person definitely not in Rowling's target demographic."
1,"Seriously, anyone who hasn't heard her story, look it up. This would be a completely epic story set in the Wizarding world, that would also have naught to do with the era of Harry, Voldemort, or the like and would be truly an original story, with a setting, time period, atmosphere and feel all it's own. I'd literally see it ten times if done right.The story of Isolt Sayre: THIS needs to be made into a movie"
1,"I've just completed a reread of *The Deathly Hallows* (actually, of the whole series); the first time since it first came out in 2007. At the time, I had no strong reactions to the Epilogue, but the poor recreation in the film adaptation and the general tone of discussions about it had led to think of it as a particularly shoddy piece of writing.

I was pleasantly surprised then that it's well... *fine*, and far from the weakest writing in this novel in particular\*. I tried reading some articles and prior discussions on this subreddit, and from what I gather, some of the themes of the complaints revolve around the fact that it's a lightweight piece of fluff, and the names Harry picked out for his kids.

As an addendum to the story, however, I feel like the entire point of the chapter's existence is to hammer home the fact that peace and tranquility has been restored to the world our characters inhabit. Its very mundanity is the key to its existence; after the final confrontation and its immediate aftermath, Rowling seemed to want to emphasize what it was all for: so children can see their kids off to school, and for those kids to be able joke around, tease each other, and not have to worry about anything other than learning and enjoying themselves. For Harry as a character, it's the easygoing existence he was always denied, and for us as readers, it's a return to the relatively lighthearted tone of the first novels - the excitement that accompanied a step into a world filled with wonder, but not necessarily danger.

As for the names of the kids, to be honest, the worst thing I can point out about them is their predictability, and that's only because it's so appropriate. *Of course* Harry named two of them after his dead parents; if he didn't, Rowling would've had to work to justify it, and that wasn't the point of the chapter. As for Albus Severus, he of the green eyes and more sensitive temperament, it's all the more meaningful. A running arc throughout *Deathly Hallows* is Harry reconciling his view of Dumbledore and how much the latter had shaped his, Harry's, life with the reality of his actions and history. The chapter ""King's Cross"" is devoted almost entirely to resolving this lingering tension: Harry learns the truth about his mentor, comes to understand the circumstances and motivations behind the choices he made, including the ugly ones. Ultimately, Harry accepts that whatever and whoever Dumbledore was, he helped shape Harry into the man he had become, a man Dumbledore himself considered greater than he. Learning about Snape was similar, in that Harry was confronted with the realization that his own judgment of Snape's character was misinformed and made without an understanding of key factors that drove Snape's actions and decision-making. Though both flawed human beings (and yes, Snape moreso than Dumbledore), they ultimately rose over those flaws (unlike Voldemort, who could never master his own vanity and power-lust) and died as heroes. It makes perfect sense that the spotlighted son would be named after these two characters specifically, at the end of this particular book especially.

\*While I loved the climax of Harry's central character arc, particularly the way the themes of self-sacrifice and acceptance of mortality play into the resolution of the conflict, there was much about *Deathly Hallows*' writing that I found weaker compared to the best of the series. Off the top of my head, Voldemort summoning the Sorting Hat to enable Neville to draw the sword and kill Nagini felt incredibly contrived (as well as anti-climactic compared to everything that happened prior), and Mrs. Weasley having a Big Damn Heroes moment felt goofy. Much of the set-up and payoff of the mysteries in *Hallows* was weaker, mainly due to the structure. Discovering and destroying the diadem, obtaining the Deathly Hallows, etc. all feel less earned and impactful, partly because they come up and are resolved in short succession, instead of our being fed clues as other plot beats happen as per the previous novels.I'm surprised at the level of derision lobbed at the Epilogue"
1,All jokes but am I wrong?
1,"since we all know HBO has decided to work on expanding the HP universe , which project would u guys willing to watch  ; the Marauders or a detailed work on Voldemorts orgin and rise to power? 

~ let me know what u guys think in the comments. 

I'd go with the voldy storyline personally, the movies did him dirty. if hbo does go for a Voldemort series, we can expect something dark and gritty. plus would love to see Ralph do his thing (if/when we'll see an older version of Voldemort)Marauders or Voldemort"
1,Only Ron knows from Bill and therefore should be the only one who can see the cottage. Or can you see the empty cottage and not the people?Why wasnt James Potter his own secret keeper like Bill and Arthur Weasley? Also Bill never tells Harry about Shell cottage. How can Harry see it then when he gets there with Dobby? I am guessing Dobby could apparate to Shell Cottage without having ever been there because elf magic is different.
1,"In Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore takes Harry to convince Slughorn to come teach at Hogwarts, and once they finish, he takes Harry to the Burrow. When they get there, Molly is surprised to see Harry so early and says she didn’t expect him until morning, and Dumbledore says that Slughorn was much easier to convince than anticipated. So what was Dumbledore planning on doing with Harry all night? Surely it would’ve been weird to stay at Slughorn’s house just talking all night. Did Dumbledore have something more dramatic planned?What was Dumbledore planning with Slughorn that would take all night?"
1,Who would you say the top five most intelligent/skilled characters are?
1,"I'm listening to The Goblet of Fire with the kids.  Got me to wondering: Why didn't Harry just refuse to participate? It would have proven to Ron that he really didn't put his name in the cup and nobody would have hated him. Even just doing nothing if they put on the field or promising to throw the match, then doing it.Why didn't Harry simply refuse to join the tri-wizard tournament?"
1,"Like there may be a spell to walk on water, you could also transfigure water into wine and heal people. And people didn't know of magic so the were like ""woah!"" And didn't have a clue. Like God could've just been a wizard who was very powerful. And it's kind of weird that every culture had belief in a higher power before we got ways to communicate with other cultures, so maybe all the 'gods' were just wizards showing themselves. 

What do you think?Was Jesus (and other known people) maybe just wizards, hear me out"
1,"Basically the whole order was out fighting at first, then looking at his (Dd's) body afterward. Mcgonagall comes into the nurses office right after the rest of them get there, and she doesn't leave until harry goes with her, where she's the new principal, so no one had been in there, or had any reason to, i mean it's just an office. But harry gets there and the picture is hung up. But it wasn't up when they (H &amp;Dd) left earlier, to go to the locket cave. So how'd it get up there?How did Dumbledore's portrait get onto the wall right after he died?"

1,"&gt; “He took my blood,” said Harry.   
&gt;  
&gt;“Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”

So, Voldy can touch Harry since he has his blood now, alright. This means the protection doesn't work anymore, right? Then why:

-Can Harry not die while Voldemort lives? Why can't Voldemort kill Harry? Is it cause ""there is still a part of Harry in Voldemort, so both have to die for Harry to die""? If that's the case, why can Voldemort die while Harry is alive, they have the same blood?
- Which begs the question, can Harry kill himself?
- Also should Voldemort not be protected as well then? How come he can be killed by his own curse?How does the Blood Protection make any sense?"

1,"I don’t think it’s really all that good. I just finished rewatching the entire Harry Potter series as a refresher on an opinion I had years ago about Radcliffe’s acting. Obviously, in the first few films he is still a child; developing and learning how to hone his acting abilities. That is excusable and justifiable. However, in even the very last film, Deathly Hallows part 2, there are moments on screen where his delivery is so bland and boring that I wonder why the producers just let it in. For example, at the very end when Harry is explaining who the Elder Wand truly belongs to, Ron says, “so that means...” and Harry replies with such a drool response of, “it’s mine.” He shakes the wand like it’s a toy, purses his lips and matter-a-factly gives his line. It’s terrible acting. The other major league actors in the series have a way of displacing Radcliffe for me, and completely outshining him. Even those who were not well know before the movies, like Emma Watson or Rupert Grint did such a better job then Radcliffe. Look at Luna Lovegood, that is such a personality and requires some decent acting to bring all of her quirks out. Evanna Lynch did such a phenomenal job as Luna. However, for me, both the character of Harry Potter and Radcliffe portraying him, give off such a boring, plain, nothing special delivery.Daniel Radcliffe’s Acting"

1,"Oh and Ginny dear, congratulation on making Gryffindor. Your Father and I are so proud"
1,"I'm watching Prisoner of Azkaban (again, for the 394th time) and it just struck me as I was watching the scene where Ron casts the *Riddikulus* spell on his boggart, making the spider wear roller skates...

As a wizard, how does he know about roller skates? Since they're a Muggles type of physical activity/possible transportation method. Am I missing something? (I'm also severely sleep deprived at the moment, so apologies if I point anything out that's extremely obvious or if I've glossed over some obvious detail(s) related to this)

It's only the third movie/book, so Harry or Hermione wouldn't have brought them up in any conversations yet, nor has he been out in the Muggle world compared to later books, where he would've seen someone use them? Nor do they have TVs where he could've watched it in a movie or something

I think it's a really subtle, but interesting moment to think about. The crossover of certain toys or contraptions from the Muggle world into the Wizarding world. Where is the line drawn on knowledge/applications of such things? This also makes me think of the joke shop the twins had. The scene where the Umbridge figurine is forced to cross a tightrope on a unicycle.

I guess one could apply this question to when Parvati turned the giant king cobra to a creepy-ass clown too?

Is this a possibility of there being wizarding circuses out in their world?

Or is this a ""anything not related to technology"" is fair game to being a part of the wizarding world even though they wouldn't really use those things commonly, just for entertainment, because of their magical abilities? (i.e., roller skates, unicycles, clown stuff, etc.)What's fair to assume in what belongs in both the Muggle and Wizarding worlds?"

1. In the books, it is implied that the werewolf transforms whether they are exposed to the moon or not. So should Lupin not have transformed earlier in the night when they were at the Shrieking Shack? If it was about werewolves being exposed to the moon, Lupin could have just stayed in his office and never transformed. The paragraph in the book discusses the clouds shifting and the moon coming out and then Lupin transforming. 

2. When Lupin describes the wolfsbane potion, he says if he takes it the entire week preceding the full moon, he keeps his mind when he transforms. So even if he did not take it that night, he should have still been in control and transformation should have been bearable by the books own rules. 

3. Snape (under the invisibility cloak) hears Lupin explain how Sirius was an animagus at the SS. But later in the series, when Dumbledore finally reveals the big dog is Sirius, Snape acts as if he dint know...i mean its pretty clear he dint know. He doesnt mention this even after Sirius escapes.

But he knew. Harry Potter knew.  \* \* \*  The next three weeks were the stuff of legend.  Dudley wore a lightening-bolt scarlet sweater. Harry heard  about fifty-five hundred birthday parties in that time. Dudley  started a club called ‘To Harry Who Lived.’ They made things. Their clubhouse was a   rainforest hut in the back garden, and once Harry went up to   talk to the leader of the group. He was called Harry.  Harry was the first to get magic. He found his wand  in a newts’ shed on Privet Drive.  Harry’s godfather, James Potter, made his entrance that  week. Potter’s clothes were not in a little black suitcase; he   was dressed in a double-breasted grey suit, with a  silver-grey tie and a silver-grey handkerchief. His shoes  were silver-grey too. He smiled very deliberately at Harry and  said: ‘Good morning, Harry. It is an  exciting day. I   have been asked to be your godfather.’ Harry was filled with   shock.  ‘You can call me James,’ said Potter. ‘Now,  how  did you do that?’ Harry put his hand into his pocket. ‘A  dromeda sting,’ he said. ‘That bit said.’  Potter laughed. ‘A no-Muggle underwater telephone system  maybe. I suppose it’s enough that my godson knows how to do  magic.’  He started to lift his trouser legs up as if to get into his trousers. ‘I  do mean that,’ Potter said. ‘That knowledge that you have is  very special and very rare. It’s just not possible that  anyone should have it.’  Potter reached down to untie his shoes, which were tightly laced.  Harry stood up and stretched. ‘Um,’ he said,  ‘I  invented  something new, but I’m not ready to tell you about it yet.’  ‘No time like the present,’ said Potter. ‘The laboratory is downstairs.

1,"How much control does the Imperious Curse give the wizard who casts it?  
Would you have to fully and consciously choose every action your victim makes, or is it more like creating a full clone of yourself (complete with your goals, choices and skill level). Or somewhere in-between?  


For example; 

If Dumbledore used imperious on a first year, would he be limited to the skill level of the victim? Or would the victim be able to do anything Dumbledore is capable of? 

Would it be a once-and-done type spell, or would Dumbledore have to remember to let the victim use the bathroom or speak during class? 

If someone's talking to an Imperious victim, do they just answer on auto-pilot and say whatever Dumbledore would want them to say? 

Or is a small part of Dumbledore's consciousness inside the victim to respond in real time? 

Would the victim of Dumbledore's Imperious be able to pull off fire-y stunts with ease? 

When Draco is controlling Rosmerta, does Draco need to know how Rosemerta would normally act/work in order to avoid suspicion? 

Is is the caster able to incorporate the victim's normal behavior into the curse to avoid detection?

Could you imperious someone to act 100% as they would normally act?  

Could your victim imperious another victim to the same efficiency? 

If you Imperious-ed someone to imperious 2 people and then those victims 2 more, pyramid scheme-style would you essentially be creating auto-pilot clones?Headcanon: Imperious Curse"

1,"I was re-reading book one, and something jumped out at me. The beginning of chapter three said that the zoo incident had earned Harry his longest ever confinement to the cupboard, and that by the time he was let out, the summer holidays had already begun. But Dudley’s birthday is *in* summer. Harry’s birthday is in July, and Petunia said in book six that Harry is a month younger than Dudley. So Dudley’s birthday is in June. 

Just think about that. They kept him locked in the cupboard for a *whole year.* For comparison, Harry only got a week in the cupboard for growing his hair too fast. Just think about spending a solid year in a cupboard. No social interaction, no exercise, no showers, no sunlight, no visits to the doctor or dentist, no school, no opportunity to do so much as stretch your legs.....that’s completely insane. It’s the sort of thing that would fuck a child up for *years.* Being in such a tiny space for so long, having to stoop your back and being unable to stretch your legs would *definitely* cause physical disfigurement and severe muscle loss. Just imagine spending a *whole year* alone in a dark, cramped cupboard. That’s literally torture.

To be fair, the date of Dudley’s birthday wasn’t revealed until book six, and there were no hints in book one that this was taking place during the summer. So maybe we were meant to assume that it was a month or so. But, going strictly by canon, Harry spent an entire year in the cupboard. 

Fuck the Dursleys. There’s a special place in hell for people like them. Biggest thing missing from the series is them suffering any sort of consequences for their actions.

1,"Hi! My partner and I just finished the movie series last night and LOOOOVVVVVED them. Hoping some of the more knowledgeable Harry Potter fans can help with this one, as the books (which I have not read *yet*) may do a better job of explaining this... (or maybe there’s som fan wisdom I don’t have yet).

In the movies, it seems that a dramatic emphasis is placed on explaining that Harry lived because of his **Mother** making the ultimate sacrifice and giving her life to save Harry’s. I feel like this comes up an awful lot throughout the movies, which is a *truly* beautiful sentiment. My questions, however... Did Harry’s Father not also make that same sacrifice by being killed by Voldemort protecting his wife &amp; son? 

Just curious why there seems to be so much emphasis on the “Mother’s love” &amp; not the “parents’ love” being what protected Harry.

1,"Sorry for the weird title, couldnt think of one. I'm talking about three characters in particular, Snape, sirius and Lupin. Lupin and sirius were played by actors in their mid 40s and Snape was played by an actor who was 55.
Now, don't think I'm downplaying any of their performances, they were all absolutely amazing portrayals, I doubt Alan Rickmans and Gary Oldmans performances will be easy to live up to for the actors who may portray them (if the upcoming series is a retelling, which I personally have doubts it is.) I've noticed that in alot of conversations about recasting that people seem to be going for actors along the age range of the previous actors, even though (and I just recently found this out) all three of these characters were in their early thirties when introduced. Snape being about 31, Sirius and Lupin being about 33Just now noticing this, but the movies left odd views of certain characters ages."

1,"I recently finished TDH again, after a couple years (also bought my own book set, hell yeah). I was nearing the end when I noticed something I'd never seem before.

In book 7, after the King's Cross dream, Harry has to play dead. Voldemort sends Narcissa Malfoy (Draco's mom) to check if Harry is dead. Thus us the part I finally noticed: Narcissa obviously sees that Harry is alive, but instead if blowing his cover, she asks if Draco is alive. When Harry says he his, Narcissa helps him out by saying he's dead.

Holy crap. I never paid too much attention to Narcissia before, outside of that one scene in HBP where she and Draco are at Madam Makins's. But seeing this now was mind-blowing. So I look her up on the HP wiki, and checked with the other books.

Narcissa is obviously still a blood purist, but she never actually joined the Death Eaters. She literally cared so much about her family that she *literally betrayed Voldemort*, because she knew the only way she could go and find her son was if she went back to Hogwarts. But she could only do that as a Death Eater. It also means Harry is inadvertently protected by a mother's love again.

Goddamn, I never know when a writer intentionally tried to blow my mind of if it just worked out, but either way, this completely makes me look at the Malfoys differently. Next time I reread the books, I need to pay more attention.I reread the books again (since 10th grade), and I noticed something amazing about Harry and Narcissia in the last book"

1,"I am here to list the pros and cons of being muggle-born.  


Pros

1. No annoying siblings at Hogwarts
2. (In accordance to 1)  You are a witch/wizard and your siblings are not #getRektSiblings
3. Eventually will have an understanding of both the wizarding and muggle communities
4. Amaze people with simple sleight of hand muggle magic tricks
5. Having a basic knowledge of science and mathematics 
6. Great songs
7. A technological understanding
8. You can survive without magic
9. It's all real.

These pros are mainly base around understanding things that wizards do not which is an excellent skill for many things such as, blending in with muggles. A wizard wouldn't expect you to be walking around with a phone in your hand and calling someone. These muggle skills are valuable and make you a more able person.   


Cons

1. Very small chance of Slytherin, if that is your house
2. Discrimination
3. Being like WTF at everything in the wizarding world. (ex: WTF is a dementor)
4. Not knowing any wizard friends
5. No technology at Hogwarts
6. Wizards don't know of anything you like (wizard: Why are the stars having wars???)
7. Can't read people's genius theories on reddit
8. Having to leave your pets. You might have a cat but it's ""The Family's""
9. Going into a state of dream-like shock upon figuring out one of your dreams came true.

These cons are based more upon not knowing, opposite the pros. I do believe that most of these cons are bearable in exchange for being a witch or a wizard, except for no. 1. I do think that there is a way around this. Hypothetically, in the muggle-born position, wishing to be in Slytherin is very ambitious, which is a trait of Slytherin, so the Sorting Hat would likely put one in Slytherin.  


These are just my observations, feel free to leave your own in the comments or ask for an explanation of one of these pros and cons.Muggle-born pros and cons"

At first I was thinking of doing 2 snakes. 2 because of the Twins and a snake representing Draco.. but I want to add details in each snake to be a little more interesting and to make more sense, like footsteps, patronus, or a wand but really, I don’t know.

When Harry meets Quirrell for the first time in the leaky cauldron, Quirrell is described as pale and nervous but no mention is made about his turban. Then when Harry arrives at Hogwarts and gets sorted he looks up at the staff table and sees Quirrell again, this time the turban is pointed out. “He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.” I always assumed, mostly because of the movies, that he was wearing his turban at the leaky cauldron as well but now I’m not so sure. So now I wonder if he wasn’t wearing it, did he have hair or was he bald? When Voldemort entered his body did all his hair fall out or did he shave his head to prep for his possession? 
Anyways, just felt the need to get this random Hp thought out of my head and a group of fellow potterheads seemed like a good place to do it. Have a good week fellow wizards!Quirrell and his turban"

""He desired her, that was all,"" sneered Voldemort, ""but when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him –""

So Voldemort thought all Snape needed was a shag. Some Snape haters think Snape was an incel. Both fail to understand the love Snape felt for Lily and mistake it for sexual desire.Parallel between Voldemort and some Snape haters"

1,"I still can’t get over the shock of the graveyard scene and the aftermath. 

I remember the first time I saw GOF I was a kid and of course I was watching it because it was Harry Potter and the visuals were cool, because I was a kid without the capacity to look at the deeper story line. 

The creepy rat looking dude from the last movie emerges from the gloom, and then all of a sudden, BAM, Cedric’s motionless on the ground and Harry’s getting choked by a statue’s sickle. And then I see the rat looking dude approach Harry and draw out a dagger and cut Harry’s arm open and the blood dripping from it. I bury my head in a pillow until the entire scene is over. Then I hear the Hogwarts music and Harry’s laying over motionless Cedric - why isn’t Cedric moving? And then it dawns on me like it dawns on the rest of the crowd - he’s dead. And then we see Harry’s arm cut in brighter lighting, and for some reason I thought he was close to death so I turned off the DVD player and put the movie away. 

I had nightmares about that scene for a few weeks and it was only when the Half Blood Prince came out (OOTP was already out, I just didn’t know about it), that I finally realized he didn’t die and was okay, so that got me comfortable with HP again.

I mean even now it still hits. I wince when I see his arm getting cut and it gives me chills when I see Cedric’s dead body laying there when Harry brings him back - the music playing and just how DEAD he looks. Like Cedric died at 17, I’ve made it past 17, and it chills me to think that if I were in his shoes in that universe it could’ve been me laying in that position. And then people’s reactions as the horror sets in... goddamn that’s messed up. 

Wondering if anyone else had similar reactions.Anyone else have nightmares over the GOF graveyard scene as a kid?"

Hi All, 

I saw this and wanted to share it.

I could not post the link or the amazing back cover, which some of you may have seen already. What struck me were the recommendations from people and I no longer really know, and how the books have dwarfed those recommendations.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the main article-(from yahoo UK news)

A bookshop is offering two rare Harry Potter first editions for sale — for a whopping £107,500.

The books — an original paperback edition and hardback version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone — are believed to be the only two on sale in the whole of the country, with the only other paperback available in the United States.

They are now being sold by St Mary's Books in Stamford, Lincolnshire who are hoping to fetch a six-figure sum for the rare finds.

While the first edition paperback, released in 1997, was once available for £4.99 it is on sale for £12,500.

The hardback edition released at the same time, with only 500 copies printed, has a £95,000 price tag — working out at £426 per page.

Shop owner Marcus Tyers, 40, from Stamford, said: “The hardback is extremely rare and is the sort of book that could have been sitting in your bookcase for a long time.

“The paperback is an interesting one in that it's from the exact same sheets and pages as the hardback as they were printed at the same time.

“The only difference is the hardback was printed 500 times whereas the softback was published 5,000 times.""Independent bookshop is selling rare Harry Potter first editions for a combined £107,500"

1,"*Ginny Weasley* - had a pretty substantial character arc, but it all happened in the background. Basically every scene Ginny’s in in books 5/6 she’s being amazing. I personally think she should have joined the Golden Trio sometime around Book 4, and it should have been the Golden Quartet after that. It’s possible JKR didn’t want to change the iconic trio, but I think it would have worked. ATLA fans remember how the trio only got better after Toph was introduced in Season 2, so it can be done really well!

*Viktor Krum* - and to some extent Fleur Delacour. I’m rereading GoF right now and all I would change is to remove SPEW and replace it with more scenes of the champions interacting. In fact I think it would have been awesome to see them grow a kind of competitor’s respect and actually bond over the danger of the tournament. In fact it would have been awesome if they all fought Voldy and the death eaters together at the end (not sure how the plot would have to change to make this work, but still) and then mourn together over Cedric’s death. In any case, Krum was a pretty chill dude and I wish we got more of his and Harry’s interactions because they have a fairly obvious shared interest in Quidditch.

Anyways, those are the two that jump out to me. Thoughts?Characters that deserved more development/page time, in my opinion"
1,"When I was reading the books for the first time I thought it was kind of obvious that Filch was related to Dumbledore in some way. Filch openly disliked Dumbledore and the changes he implemented at the school (no more corporal punishment) and he also openly preferred Umbridge to Dumbledore. And although I think it’s great that Dumbledore employed a squib, a magical caretaker would have been much more effective. He also hated students! Why was this his job? Dumbledore never attempting to replace Filch always confused me and I thought them being related would have made a lot of sense. The Dumbledore’s were a proud wizarding family and I could definitely see them trying to keep a squib in the family on the down low and therefore alienating their son which would explain Filch’s personality. The fact that it was never discussed that they were brothers also made sense because Filch seemed to hate Dumbledore, and wouldn’t want anyone knowing that he only had the position because he was Dumbledore’s brother. I could definitely see Dumbledore feeling guilty about his family’s treatment of Filch in the past, reaching out to his estranged brother and offering him a job, and Filch agreeing with the condition that no one is to know they are brothers. 

As soon as I started the seventh book and learned more of Dumbledore’s past this theory crumbled, but I would have found Filch being Dumbledore’s brother a much more satisfying reveal than Aberforth. The entire Dumbledore family history was introduced in the final book, Filch was there from book one.Filch should have been Dumbledore’s brother"

1,"TL;DR: Pottermore/Wizarding World only has three wand ‘looks’. I bought a replica before I realised this and I feel cheated because every wand is supposed to be unique. I would like a wand that truly pertains to ME, my personality, my character etc. If anyone can help me get a wand that looks unique, but still Harry Potter-esque, and actually pertains to ME, I would be extremely grateful! Thank you!

\*\*\*

Hi, I’m Dakky.

I recently logged onto the Wizarding World website (originally Pottermore, I believe) and I got sorted into my house, found out my wand and discovered my Patronus.

Sorted into Ravenclaw: perfect. I know I’m smack-bang in the middle of Ravenclaw and Slytherin, but I believe I pertain to Ravenclaw more effectively, so I’m happy with that choice.

Patronus was a hedgehog: was a bit underwhelming (especially considering I have friends who have been assigned Hippogriffs before…) but, upon thinking about it, I do feel quite like a hedgehog, I suppose. I’m a little harsh on the outside but kind on the inside. I’m also small, if that has anything to do with it (which it probably doesn’t in the wizarding world, but who knows…)

But then there was the wand. Now, the wand thing really pees me off. Not because I have anything against a 10” Chestnut hard wand with a Unicorn hair core – but because there are ONLY. THREE. IMAGES. OF. WANDS.

When I found out this piece of information, I was like… are you JOKING me? Because I was extremely excited about my Wizarding World/Pottermore wand, so I bought a replica online. It basically feels like I’ve been cheated, because it’s not *truly* what my wand would have looked like, is it? Especially considering Ollivander said that no two wands are the same.

Of course, he didn’t just mean visually, he also meant internally and temperamentally – but the look of the wand can’t just be disregarded when he stated that no two wands are the same, otherwise how would we have multiple extremely unique wands from the movies?

I just feel sort of cheated, because I bought my wand thinking it was unique. That perhaps there would be more than just a handful of wand looks.(There isn’t even a HANDFUL, there’s THREE.)

I really wanted to get a wand that connects with ME. Not that is coded to a few silly questions about my height and eye colour.

I know the wand chooses the wizard and there’s no TRUE way to get that to happen in real life… and I know that I’m kind of just seeking out a different wand even though the Wizarding World wand ‘chose’ me… but I don’t know. It just doesn’t feel legitimate to me. It’s unsatisfying to say the least.

So, FINALLY, here’s the question. Does anyone know where I could have someone actually assess me and pair me with a suitable wand?Someone who designs wands and who can help me get a wand look that resonates with me?Someone who maybe knows a lot about wands in the HP universe and can help me with this?Someone like (dare I say) a metaphorical Ollivander?

I guess I just want to be original because I know, should the HP universe be real, everyone’s wand would be.

Thanks for reading my rant haha! I’m sure no one will reply or help because I understand that it’s a tricky question to answer. But, if anyone does take the time to respond and help me out, I’d be extremely thankful.

Thanks everyone!

EDIT: I don't know why people are downvoting me and my comment. I've asked a genuine question and am looking for help.Can anyone help me get a wand that suits me?"

Some contain their appearance description, others dwell on their personality, and I never forget some of the coolest achievements!

1,"I feel like this sub has a lot more people who view him very negatively. On YouTube and deviantart, most people seem sympathetic to Snape. The podcasts I listen to have a more nuanced take on him, but most still seem to lean towards a more positive view of him, as does Shmoop.com (I got bored once and read their summaries). I know that Snape is supposed to be a gray character, but most of the time he seems to be seen in a more positive light outside of this subreddit, while on the sub people seem to view him as an unambiguous villain. Has anyone else noticed this?Is it just me or does this sub hate Snape a lot more than the average fan?"

1,"As I understand it these two things are true - 

1. Harry had a bit of Voldemort's soul in him 
2. Dementors can suck out a bit of soul from a witch or wizard

So does this mean that theoretically a dementor could have sucked Voldemort's soul out of Harry (and sure would have sucked out Harry's own soul too). Would this then have destroyed the soul as we hear that once a dementor takes your soul, that's it, your toast, there's no getting it back. 

What do you all think?Could dementors have sucked voldemort's soul out of Harry?"

1,"currently reading half blood prince and there's a scene in chapter 24 where harry has detention with snape after using sectumsempra on malfoy. 

he's asked to sort out old files of past hogwarts students and the punishments that they received for rule breaking.

snape suggests that harry start w box 1012 - 1056 and the first file harry pulls out is about james and sirius.

now i don't think i have to elaborate on why this is significant but this is just another instance where snape is purposefully insensitive towards harry and takes pleasure in his misery. pls keep in mind that harry is only 16 at the time. he is a child that has experienced an unfortunate and unfathomable amount of trauma and loss for his age that should in no way be mocked. yet snape finds every y opportunity to do so .

personally i think snape is an awful person and this scene, among many, just rudely reminded me of that.

Like you have this whole space to yourself and you don’t use it? When everybody thought that he put his name in the goblet and everybody pointed fingers why didn’t he escape to the only place only he had access to? Why doesn’t he want to learn more about parseltongue. He saw draco performing “serpensortia” and why didn’t he try to learn it? It’s basically the most helpful spell for him because it summons little helpers when he needs them. I also read this fanfic where he bred basilisk and he know how and he knows that basilisks are loyal to the bloodline to the master so why not do it? Why doesn’t he read up on every magical snake possible and try to buy and breed it so that he has a snake army at his command and loyal to him?  I also refuse to accept that Ron was able to open the chamber in DH. I believe that even if you replicate the sounds it doesn’t work because it is a magical language and you need to have snake magic to infuse the words with. I believe you can understand it but not speak it because it is intersected with your magic and soul. I also refuse to believe that he lost the skill after losing Tom’s soul. It had been with him for at least 16 years while his magic matured and it influenced it and I believe that he kept the abilityParseltongue"

1,"Perhaps I'm missing something obvious, but the way I see it, as long as Sirius never gave the Potters' location away, they would have been safe forever. I think it's mentioned that Sirius would have been too obvious of a choice, and so the Death Eaters would have tracked him down to get the information they needed straight away. Therefore they chose Peter instead, who no one would have expected to be trusted with such important information. 

But even if they did track Sirius- so what? They could have tortured him all they wanted, but I'm certain that Sirius would have never given in. He even says so himself that he would have died before giving up his friends:

*""THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!"" roared Black. ""DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS,* ***AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!****”* \- Prisoner of Azkaban , Chapter 19

It doesn't matter that the Death Eaters know who the Secret Keeper is, as long as they never tell the secret, they are useless. 

All I can think, is that they made the switch to protect Sirius from torture and a cruel death? But that seems counter-productive, when the entire point was to save the lives of a family of three.

I'd appreciate any clarification or thoughts.I don't really understand why Sirius wanted Peter to be Secret Keeper."
1,"now im sure we all know that before snape worked for dumbledore he was a death eater spying for voldemort.

for the sake of this discussion ill be refrencing the prophecy. for a slight recap: trelawney and dumbledore are in the hogs head where trelawney relays the prophecy regarding voldemort and the chosen one to dumbledore. snape, a death eater at the time, overhears and reports what he heard to voldemort thus causing a series of unfortunate events that ultimately lead to the deaths of lily and james potter.

now i personally believe that although this was described as snapes biggest regret i still believe he should not have been allowed a job at hogwarts/redemption and let me share why. 

during the scene where harry finds out that snape was the one who told voldemort abt the prophecy dumbledore states that snape had no way of knowing that harrys parents would be voldemorts target. however had he known what outcome his actions would have had he would not have proceeded. thus i believe that snape only viewed working for voldemort as his ""biggest regret"" because lily, the woman he loved, was murdered due to voldemorts interpretation of the prophecy. but had it been anyone else i don't think he would have cared as much. 

lily dying is seen as snapes turning point and the sole reason dumbledore trusted him to work alongside him. but what if it had been anyone other than lily? would he still have changed?

Hate the Cursed Child?

Ever wondered why Harry is not behaving like himself in it? or why we barely see him or the original trio at all? Why Cedric Diggory ever becomes a Death Eater? What's the deal with Voldemort having kids? And what's with all the time travel, didn't JK Rowling specifically say she smashed all of the Time-Turners in OP to get rid of this plot device?

**What if we could make the Cursed Child better? What if we could make it fit better within the Harry Potter series?**

I'm working on a ""fix"" of the Cursed Child story with my own (upcoming) series of books (Harry Potter and The Lost Child is the first of five):

General summary: no Delphi, VERY canon adherent, the plot draws a little from the Cursed Child but improves upon it (at least in my opinion), and NO BLEEDING TIME TRAVEL.

Okay why is Harry Potter hated? 

usually people hate him cuz he's just kinda like a blank slate which I agree with he is in the first 4 books just kinda a whatever kinda guy yk? and then book 5 is where harry starts to become an actual character and where people start to hate him unpopular opinion angsty harry is the fucking best when harry is angry in book 5 he's not just spilling out anger from what happened in the graveyard no he's spilling out anger from 10 years of torment from the dursleys abusive treatment he had nobody before he went to Hogwarts he could not even go to mrs figg bcz she knew if he had too much fun he would Never be able to go and that is tragic not alot of people focus on harry's childhood he had a horrible childhood but he still remained a good kid at heart but what happened in the graveyard broke him but really broke him was learning the wizarding world didn't even believe him he just saw and experienced the most traumatic thing that happened to him at this point and you know what the people around him do? they call him the worst thing anyone can ever call him at this point... a liar a fucking liar and this shit changes a kid and to top it all of he has to go to the dursleys and stay with them all summer stealing newspapers out of bins and hiding in bushes and he has nobody to talk to none of his friends are even writing to him they're just giving him cryptic ass msgs and the one man whom harry had always known who could make things right Dumbledore didn't even acknowledge that he and harry we're on the same planet he wouldn't even look him in the eye and harry thinks he's being possessed by Voldemort and then when he finally gets to rage and let his anger out on his friends they don't argue back they comfort him and then Fred and George show up and start cracking jokes to ease the tension and then harry goes to Hogwarts where his anger is more now nobody is believing him they all think he's some crazy ass attention seeking bitch and that Voldemort is not even back and then there's umbridge who makes harry's life hell banning him from quidditch putting Hagrid on probation and ruining his life at Hogwarts and then you know what he does he starts his own DADA lessons and he's the teacher and he's loving he's finally getting the happiness he deserves until dumbleodre's army gets caught and Dumbledore leaves the school and umbrage is headmaster now jumping forward a bit harry's at the department of mysteries and then he see's the only family he has left just die right before his eyes and harry's not believing none of it wanting to go through so bad thinking that Sirius will come out of the other side of the veil smiling or something but he doesn't Sirius never kept harry waiting before and then he chases after bellatrix and he's mega angry rn failing to do the cruciatis curse and taunting bellatrix fast forward to Dumbledore's office he's there and he wants to leave as hard as he can but the door won't open and then he starts trashing Dumbledore's office screaming till his throat hurts wanting to kill himself wanting to hurt Dumbledore and wanting to die... that Is some powerful shit to make it worse he hears the truth about how Sirius died and is even more angry and feels more guilty but nothing can even come close to what happens when harry goes into his dormitory and see's the package Sirius gave him just lying and he didn't even open it and it was a 2 way mirror harry could've saved Sirius is if he just opened it and asked if Sirius was there he kept shouting at the mirror but he only say his own green eyes staring at it and then to make matters worse he goes to nearly headless and asks him if Sirius will come back as a ghost hoping that Sirius willl come out of the other side of that wall transparent and smiling at harry but alas Sirius never comes and harry finally accepts that his godfather is truly gone and that is truly heartbreaking angsty harry is harry at his best he's the harry we never expected he's not some kid who's being a meanie head at his friends he's a broken boy who suffered so much and suffered more and more and yet he still remained whole and good Harry Potter is possibly the most under appreciated character in his own franchise he's one of my favourite characters favourite out of the trio yet nobody gives him the respect he deserves long live the boy who lived

So, I think Remus and Sirius definitely had a thing in Hogwarts. However, I think that the war put a lot of tension on their relationship. Sirius thought Remus was the traitor, and vice versa. Obviously, once Sirius gets arrested Remus kind of drops his feelings.

Fast forwards 13 years, they meet again. I think that it was too complicated for them to revive their relationship, but they remained good friends.

Remus and Tonks is also a great ship, in my opinion. I think they're cute, Tonks clearly loves Remus and doesn't care that he's a werewolf :) Remus loves her a lot, and though he screws up a little, he gets his priorities right in the end.

So it may be better for him to become a ghost based in the Burrow, where he could stay in his childhood room and his family could come visit him.  Imagine him striking up a friendship with the ghoul!

Harry Potter has always been about more than just magic, it's supposed to thematically show us the nuances within us all. And about Dumbledore, the point is that he's a flawed character, he's seen as the sweetest, wittiest, saint like person, but he's not. Dumbledore knew that for the prophecy to work, he had to ""raise him like a pig"" in this instance Harry. But again, prophecy aside, the point is, the people around you, who may seem the lightest, have dark within them. Like many adult figures, they choose to hide the pain that is simply being, living with that truth as a kid can harm a child. In the end of Order of the phoenix, Dumbledore realized his plan to stay away from Harry wouldn't work, because love is what binds us and makes us strong. It actually makes sense as Dumbledore already before, had harmed his own sister which he loved the utmost. In Half Blood Prince, he realizes he needs to show his care and affection. On the surface he may seem like a bad person, but I swear there's much more thematic depth and emotional depth people don't choose to read into.

It's just frustrating to hear people with this shitty argument all the time.I feel like the people arguing that Dumbledore is a bad and manipulative person, are missing the point."

1,"I know the DH epilogue attracts a lot of criticism from fans, from the lengthy 19 year timeskip, to the kids' names, to lack of information about Hogwarts post-battle or the trios' jobs, etc. The epilogue is probably the least loved chapter of the whole series, and not just because it's the last one. This post makes a case for the significance of setting the epilogue at King's Cross. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of my argument boils down to Chapter 35 of DH: King's Cross. In every book ending except HBP, Dumbledore explains to Harry and readers the mysteries at work up to that point of the story. This was the last time Dumbledore reveals answers to some of the last and greatest mysteries of the series. It's worth reading these two visions of King's Cross, chapter 35 and the epilogue, against each other.  

&gt;“**I’ve got a choice**?”   
&gt;  
&gt;“Oh yes.” Dumbledore smiled at him. “We are in **King’s** **Cross**, you say? I think that **if you decided not to go back, you would be able to** ... let’s say ... **board a train**.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“And where would it take me?”  
&gt;  
&gt;""On,"" said Dumbledore simply. 

This is Harry's final choice of the series, taking place after he has chosen to walk freely to his own death. This is the cross roads chapter, making the epilogue a resolution to this moment. The epilogue answers the question of where Harry's life took him in his choice to go back (let's call it the train not chosen): a life where he has a family and children to send off to their own adventures. As cheesy as it is to say, because of Harry's choice not to board a train at this otherworldly King's Cross, his kids can board a train to go to Hogwarts. Whereas the journey to King's Cross occurs towards the beginning of the other 6 books, before the year's escapades at Hogwarts can start, this time we end at King's Cross where a new adventure for a new generation is bound to begin. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""But **you want me to go back**?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""I think,"" said Dumbledore, ""that **if you choose to return**, there is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**""Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love**. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. **If that seems to you a worthy goal, then we say good-bye** for the present.""

In the King's Cross limbo, Harry's first reaction is to ask if Dumbledore wants him to go back; he hasn't expressed the desire to return himself. Dumbledore plainly states Harry's life's goal, ""you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart,"" which is what the epilogue fulfills in showing us the Weasley-Granger-Potter family and a host of innocent children. Instead of families ""torn apart"" we see families formed (there's even a hint of Teddy Lupin and Victoire Weasley getting together). There was a nod to Draco Malfoy, as the poster child of un-maimed souls (it was his soul that Dumbledore and Snape schemed to protect). 

I think it's important that Harry's first reaction when facing the choice to return is to glance at the flayed child form of Voldemort. Here's how it was described earlier:

&gt;It had the form of **a small, naked child,** curled on the ground, **its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted**, stuffed out of sight, **struggling for breath**.

Voldemort had maimed his soul in order to tether his soul to life and avoid death. The name he created himself means ""flight from death,"" and this moment reveals where Voldemort's efforts have truly gotten him. Here we have the form of the most pitiable figure imaginable: ""flayed...shuddering...unwanted...struggling for breath."" It is Voldemort Dumbledore refers to when he tells Harry to ""pity the living, and above all, those who live without love."" Voldemort alone is stuck in the expanse of this mysterious in-between area. Dumbledore and Harry both leave this place because the living and the dead are able to move ""on"" in a way that Voldemort has refused to. 

In contrast with the child form of Voldemort in King's Cross, the epilogue is populated by actual children. Voldemort had damaged himself so immensely that his child form had been mutilated and suffering as a result of his actions. Harry's children bear names of the dead who, memorialized, live on in a way that Voldemort didn't all because Harry valued love. Harry moves on to a future, a life of love, which is the key difference that separates him from Voldemort.

&amp;#x200B;

The epilogue shows a lot growth in Harry compared to the young adult we saw in the King's Cross of Chapter 35. At that time, it was still Dumbledore who held all the answers and needed to answer Harry's many questions, but in the King's Cross in the epilogue, Harry has taken up Dumbledore's role of explaining and reassuring. In his role as a dad, Harry resembles Dumbledore as Harry knew him; there are echoes of his relationship to Dumbledore in his relationships with his own kids. Like Dumbledore, he's rather indulgent. He advises Albus not to let his brother rile him up, but doesn't seem too concerned about James' teasing (""he likes a laugh, your brother""). He comforts Lily, promising, “It won’t be long, and you’ll be going too.” And he tells Albus not to worry about sorting into Slytherin, revealing a secret knowledge to him alone: ""if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."" 

Harry is understated in the epilogue. People still stare at him, but his own children and niece/nephew don't seem to know why he's famous. Harry has never enjoyed his own limelight, but this ending, where there is no hint any of Harry's heroics or accomplishments, highlights the ways that Harry is fundamentally unlike the Voldemort left behind at King's Cross in chapter 35. The fact that Harry's tale as the Boy who Lived is somewhat irrelevant here (it doesn't matter to the children, who are concerned with their own Hogwarts' journeys), pushes Voldemort further into obscurity. Harry is here as a father and uncle, not as the hero of the Wizarding World or a powerful, legendary wizard. The epilogue continues Harry's story as a journey of love. The flayed figure was under a seat, ""unwanted,"" while Harry is surrounded by loved ones. It was Voldemort who clung to permanence and stagnancy. Harry, who is shown moving on as life changes, is living with love and watching his own son's ""excitement"" as his son leaves on the train. Thematically, the epilogue brought a lot of book themes full circle, even it it frustrated people in its overly-sentimental conclusion.

&gt;The train began to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son’s thin face, already ablaze with excitement. **Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away from him**. ...Epilogue at King's Cross - The Significance of HP's Ending Location"

1,"Pensieves and other magical means of telling the truth highlight one of the big weaknesses in Rowling's writing; she tends to invent these things that are very interesting for the book they're introduced in, but she doesn't take into consideration the impact said item might have on the future stories or the ones already out if they're something that, by virtue of what it can do, can break an entire storyline.

Pensieves are one such example of this, and it really shows at the end of *Goblet of Fire*.  As I believe u/JulianApostat has brought up, the fact that there are surefire ways in the Wizarding world to confirm if someone is  lying or not should have major implications for how the justice system works in the wizarding world, but whenever a trial comes up, no one even thinks  about it.   

And more importantly, there are many times throughout the books where some important events happen with either no witnesses, or the only witnesses are kids (typically Harry) and afterwards no one believes them. This is the sort of situation where the adults should look at Harry's memories of the events in question, or if still in doubt, use a Time Turner to send back an invisible observer.

A good example of this is at the end of *Goblet of Fire*, after Barty Crouch Jr. gets kissed by the Dementor that Fudge brought with him. Fudge is refusing to believe Voldemort has returned.     Everyone's like  ""Omigod, Fudge just fed the very important witness to  a Dementor, and now we have no way to prove the truth!"" Yet the  confession of Crouch Jr. is recorded in the memories of four people  along with, in one case, the very events in question. All Dumbledore has to do is make a quick dash  for the Pensieve, and suddenly Fudge is faced not with an  unsubstantiated allegation, but with irrefutable proof that  is far harder to reject without looking like a coward.   The Pensieve of Harry's memories would be very useful here, because as dense as Fudge may be, he would have a hard time claiming that Harry simply imagined the whole scene down to the very last  detail, like the real-life cemetery he'd never been to, something easily  verifiable, since Dumbledore knows of Riddle's origins. (And before anyone uses that bullshit ""memories can be altered"" argument, let me remind you that  Pensieve tampering is *really really easy to spot*. It's blatantly visible even to the naked eye of an untrained observer, such as Harry.    And that was with Slughorn, an Occlumens skilled enough to block out Dumbledore mentally)  

 That and/or they could have just used the very convenient Time Turners  introduced in the previous book to just go back in time under an Invisibility Cloak to witness the events at the  cemetery. Even if Fudge  didn't want to, it beggars belief to think that Dumbledore wouldn't be  able to prove it.   Dumbledore at this time holds a lot of  political  influence, enough that he shouldn't be so easily outplayed by Fudge. He could've gotten Harry's story out to the press, he could've had Harry testify befor the Wizengamot as to what happened, etc, etc..

Then in *Order of the Phoenix*, a pensieve would've also come in handy at Harry's trial. Harry could have demanded to have his memories checked in a Pensieve  regarding the Dementor attack, showing irrefutable proof that there were Dementors in Little Whinging, but the thought of that never crosses his mind.  If it was explained that Fudge was obstructing all attempts for Harry to get a hearing with Pensieve viewing, it would be one thing. but clearly, in both of these cases, the real reason Pensieves, Time Turners and/or Veritaserum weren't used was because they would've broken the plot.The conundrum of Pensieves and other truth-telling methods"

Four descriptions: I assume one for each house. 
Courage 
Good mind
Talent
Ambition
Looking through those I picked out the three obvious house right away and that left “talent” as Hufflepuffs. 
I know that Hufflepuff is the most underrated house (cuz I am one 😂) but I didn’t realize how underrated we actually were until now. 
I always envisioned them/us as hardworking to make up for a lack of talent. People where I am from often use that as a kind of “backhanded complement” saying things like “[something mildly insulting] but they are a hard worker!”
But now with the sorting hats words and the reminder the the “most talented/worthy” student for the triwizard tournament was a Hufflepuff, it just makes me wonder how we became so underrated?????? Is it because our qualities are just not as highly valued in today society?

METHOD:

I flipped through my Scholastic Hard-Back copies looking for all caps. I have included everything, including acronyms and signs. In some cases, signs and prints are written in all caps BUT with size distinctions between uppercase and lowercase. In this situation, I have noted them but written them in traditional upper/lowercase. Where dialogue tags / short descriptions are inserted while a person is in the middle of yelling, it is treated as a continuation of the same line, until another character interrupts. All instances of AAAUGH and NOOO etc had their letters counted.

I have also compiled data such as how much certain characters shout, and average number of all caps lines per chapter. (At bottom.)

1,"H-how did I get Dragon Patronus when i'm a HufflePuff

 and this Patronus?"
1,"There are two things that bother me (besides Rowling saying she now hates putting Ron and Hermione together, something that only happened after she took to the internet and discovered people hated it).

1. Voldemort isn't actually that big of a deal internationally

This is more of an insight I gained while I was listening to the audiobooks last time.

In Goblet of Fire, Cornelius Fudge is talking with the Bulgarian Minister of Magic (I believe he's the Bulgarian one). He suddenly comes across Harry Potter and delightedly tells his fellow national leader “This is Harry Potter, the one who killed You-Know-Who!”

And the Bulgarian basically goes, “Interesting”. Frankly, he isn't all that uber impressed by it. When I listened to this, my eyes grew wide as a sudden realization hit me.

Voldemort was a localized threat. A national phenomenon, not world-wide. Yes, he gathered dark witches and wizards to his cause and brought in foreign aid like the giants and trolls to help him.

But he never was that big of a threat outside the UK. Maybe not even into Ireland. Why? I don't think he ever actually intended the conquest of the world.

We never know what his end goal really is. But I think he only wanted the UK, purge it of the non-desirables, and would have just sat there, nice and pretty. Or ugly in his case.

Another plot point in the story reinforced this reading of how localized Voldemort actually was.

That would be Fleur Delacour. Most people simply assume it was love that kept her in the UK when Voldemort retook power. I think it's more than that.

She is French, and yet, she doesn't fear him. Fleur lived right across the English Channel and yet she wasn't taught to fear him, because for her, as a French woman, he held no power over her.

She viewed Voldemort the same way Americans viewed Fidel Castro. An evil man, but he was so small fish that the average American had no need to even think about him, nor fear him, despite him being a very close neighbor.

It’s weird because Rowling wanted to make Voldemort some sort of worldwide threat and yet when you read of foreign characters, they seem to not even care about him.

But anyway, onto what really annoys me in this universe.

2. How magic has basically stagnated the Wizarding Community

You may be scratching your heads and saying “I don't understand.” All shall be revealed to you.

In Harry Potter 1, one of the very first things Harry learns is that the wizarding community has remained secret for the sake of the Muggles. “If they knew there was magic in the world, they would want to use it to solve every problem in their lives.” Except, that's exactly what the wizarding world does!

You never see Molly Weasley do anything without magic, besides chastising her family. She cooks, she does it with magic. Cleaning, magic. She doesn't even turn the knob on her radio by hand, instead using magic to do it.

She literally can stand, move and turn on her radio. Then again, we don't turn on TVs if we don't have to but we are talking about the wizarding world.

Harry breaks his arm during the Second Year Quidditch match when hit by a Bludger. Then Lockheart tries to fix it, instead completely making the bones disappear! What if it had been a leg? What if, heaven forbid, it was Harry's skull!

He doesn't even feel that overly bad about it. Why? Because magic! By the very next day, all Harry's bones have been regrown. In a single day and night!

You get hurt in the Wizarding world, and there is almost nothing that can't be instantly cured. Instead of being bed-ridden for weeks, you are up and about, as if nothing has happened.

In Deathly Hallows when they are setting up for a massive meal prior to the wedding of Bill and Fleur, the boys decide to get into a magical battle with all the tables and chairs. They break several pieces of furniture, yet there is no consequences besides Molly screaming at them. They don't have to go out and buy new furniture, dipping into their small banking accounts.

Why? Because magic instantly fixes all the furniture.

There is nothing learned from the experience. They aren't forced to go without a table or chairs for their reckless behavior, they don't have to spend any money on it. There is no punishment for destroying the furniture.

Magic has turned the entire society stagnant. Their most modern technology? Radios and moving photographs. Men haven't gotten to a point they wear jeans; just robes. They don't have electricity, which astonishes them so greatly that an entire class in muggle studies revolves around electricity. I think a scene from the movies describes their utterly Medieval Society.

The “rubber duck” comment. While a movie-only line, I think it was put in the movie to show how magic has put them so out the times of the world around them. They are so simplistic in their level of technology that one of the simplest things in the Muggle World is beyond their comprehension.

Let us also not think about how they literally have a tournament that they send their kids to where their chances of dying are extremely high. Their very first trial? Facing off against a dragon that their spells have little effect on. Yes, it’s only meant for 6th Years on up, but this was only after they revised the rules because too many kids were being killed in it.

It’s like magic completely made them irresponsible as adults and guardians for the very kids they are supposed to be protecting.

Magic is very important to the wizarding world…..but perhaps it is too important to them.

So what bothers YOU the most?What bothers you about the Harry Potter books?"

1,I’m finishing my re-read of The Half Blood Prince and realizing just how daunting it is that Harry is going to have to search for the other horcruxes on his own after seeing all of the skill that Dumbledore displays when getting the locket from the cave.

1,"They're hilarious. You can watch them all together on YouTube and it's about 3 hours long but it's so worth it. Check it out!If you haven't seen the Lego Harry Potter cutscenes, you should."
1,"Voldemort is vanquished for the first time in 1981, as we know, and does not truly reappear in any meaningful way until 1991.

My questions are as follows:

1. What was he doing during this time? I saw an old post that said: ""Voldemort was living off of rats and snakes. Inhabiting their bodies long enough to survive before moving on. We know he had some magical abilities at that point, but they were severely limited on his host body."" Is this mentioned in the books? How weak of a condition was he in, magically speaking?

Without the help of Quirrell or any of his other followers, would he have remained in that weakened condition in the Albanian Forest permanently?

2. Did most of his former followers believe him to be permanently gone? IIRC the only people who believed he would come back were Dumbledore, Snape, Barty Crouch Jr, and Bellatrix - am I wrong?

3. Did any of his former Death Eaters (even ones like Malfoy) hold ANY level of genuine regret over their actions, even if they still believed in 'the cause?'

4. Getting to the Prophecy, was it inevitable? What I mean is, was it 'destined', if you will, that Voldemort would return and be defeated by Harry? Or did Voldemort himself set the Prophecy into motion by going after Harry in the first place? For example...Say he disregarded the Prophecy, and didn't go after the Potters....What then? Would Harry still have grown up to be able to challenge him some other way? I'm curious about what the books (I haven't read them in a LONG time) or Rowling has said about the role Destiny or Fate played in it.

5. A controversial question....I know as a young man Dumbledore had a bit of ""prejudice"" shall we say against Muggles, and that is in part what initially made him join with Grindlewald in their idea of a ""pure"" world. Would a younger, pre-Arianna's death Albus have joined Voldemort? Or was he too strong minded to be a follower?

Thanks all. Again, I haven't read the books since they first came out; and I'm 30 now and wanting to rediscover the world. So answers would be more than appreciated!Questions about Voldemort between 1981 and 1991, the Prophecy, and the Death Eaters"
1,"Couldn't Harry, after all the humiliation, have become a dangerous psychopath?

upd: Right, I’ve forgot about the spell. Thanks for reminding, and sorry for flooding.Why did Dumbledore think it was a good idea to leave Harry with abusive relatives?"
1,"This is so ill-founded and wrong, especially because in the actual books she is never even mentioned to be physically punished. Here are the punishments that we know she received:

1. Voldemort distanced himself from her and they stopped speaking after the Department of Mysteries fiasco.

2. He confined her to Malfoy Manor after Harry's escape.

Here are the punishments others who made the same mistakes got:

1. Voldemort sent Lucius's only son on a suicide mission. 

2. Lucius bore the marks from his punishment for Malfoy Manor for at least two months even though Bellatrix was the one who actually summoned Voldemort.

3. Rowle and Dolohov were Cruciated and threatened to be fed to Nagini for letting Harry escape.

She was unscathed and very close to Voldemort in the final battle merely a day after the Cup was stolen from her vault, but Voldemort's anger was said to be 'terrible to behold' when he forced the truth about the diary out from Lucius. He made amends to her only for humiliating her in the meeting and even reassured her, but his response to Lucius worrying about the safety of his child was 'it's not my fault if your son dies'. Priorities, I suppose.

Then why is the headcanon that Voldemort punished Bella more frequently and intensely than the others so popular? Is this some sort of...kink?Why do people say Voldemort punished Bellatrix more intensely than the other Death Eaters?"

1,"Hi all,

First post here, but I just started re-reading the series for like the 4th or 5th time tonight. As I read Chapter 1 of the first book, I realized a kind of random and funny observation I’ve always been curious about. 

In the section where Vernon Dursley is heading home from work and he bumps into someone, does anyone remember if we’re ever told explicitly who that is? I realize that’s a super small detail, but for me personally I’ve always imagined it as Professor Flitwick  (at least from my second read through on, I obviously didn’t think of it in my first read.) 

My main reason why is because the individual is described as “a tiny old man wearing a violet cloak” having “ a squeaky voice that made passerby stare” and also as “hugging Mr. Dursley around the waist”. Essentially, a very short, older wizard with a squeaky voice and violet cloak. To me, it matches the film adaptation of Flitwick in the first movie almost perfectly, which has always made me wonder.Sorcerer’s/Philosopher’s Stone - Chapter 1"

1,"I saw a post asking about people’s opinions about the Fantastic Beasts series and it reminded me of a huge problem I see with them. They have majorly overpowered the wizards in FB. 

First off, at the beginning of CoG, Grindelwald disintegrates the German Minister of Magic’s wand without even being in the carriage with him and causes the other auror’s wands to fly out of their hands and basically hold them hostage. That is completely out of line with the established magic in Harry Potter. If a wizard is able to just disintegrate a wizards wand without even being near them then there’s literally nothing else to do. Everyone would just do that and automatically win every duel bc the opponents wand is gone. Like what stopped Voldemort from just hiding behind a wall and disintegrating Harry’s wand when he wasn’t expecting it? No one would stand a chance. And wands obey their owners so how would Grindelwald be able to cause the auror’s wands to fly out of their hands and hold them hostage? Even if you could do that, no one is holding that wand. It’s not a gun, it doesn’t just fire randomly. A wizard would need to cast a spell with the wand for it to do anything so how would Grindelwald make another wizard’s wand work without even being in the same carriage?? It makes me so mad hahaha 

Also, at the end of CoG, Grindelwald just hands Credence a random wand and Credence, who has never even held a wand before and has no formal magical education, casts a NONVERBAL spell that makes a whole mountaintop blow up. First, the whole HP series went into painstaking detail to establish that wizards don’t just use any old wand. The wand chooses the wizard. I know that any wizard can use any wand, but the resulting magic won’t be very good. Plus, Hogwarts students don’t learn nonverbal magic until year 6 and even then a lot of them can’t get it to work bc it’s super complex. They just tossed all that out the widow when they had Credence cast a very complex spell nonverbally with a wand that does even chose him. Come on, there’s no way that would work with everything they’ve established in HP. Just my rant about it but I’m excited to hear what other people think!Crimes of Grindelwald Problems"
1,"As an avid reader, writer, movie-watching, wand-collecting, theory-reading dedicated Harry Potter lover, I just can't bring myself to dislike the movies, the new Fantastic Beasts movies, or any idea for a possible or impossible HBO show. I just love the spirit of the world. I know many people don't feel the same, but just try to change my mind. Now, the Cursed Child was not my favorite, but let's still appreciate it for what it is. The author was trying something new, and it turned out alright.I just can't dislike the Wizarding World. Any of the wizarding world."

Lupin: I don't, I find it disgusting.
James: Really? Seems the werewolf has a problem with me Padfoot.

If Lupin had truly put his foot down about James' attitude to Snape, how long would it have been before the entire school found out about his condition and is then abandoned by his friends. Lupin did not agree with what James and Sirius did, but Lupin could have lost everything if he went against them.Why do people give Lupin a hard time, in Snape's worst memory?"
1,"To preface, Harry is my favorite character. But i oftem read how people think he's a flat or boring character. And after thinking about it, i feel it's kinda true? While i like his charavteristics to start with, he doesn't really develop and is very static. He always does the ""right"" thing, never has to question his morality or decisions. He is pretty much the same dude in PS and DH, albeit a bit more confident. I'm not saying he has to change a ton, but still. 

Also, i find it hard to describe what makes Harry different from everyone else? Like if someone asked, what makes Harry, Harry? What is his defining trait, what is something that you immediately think of when thinking of Harry? Is it just bravery?

1,"And I don't think Ravenclaw is the house that suits her best, either. I think this will get long since I've found a good amount of stuff in the books to support the claim that Hermione's personality is very much Slytherin in a lot of ways. The only thing that prevented her from being sorted into it is her muggle heritage and the only reason muggleborns are not sorted into Slytherin is plot convenience to make Slytherin the evil house full of pureblood supremacists and have a defined group of antagonists in Hogwarts.

Let's look at the traits associated with each house.


Gryffindor: courage, bravery, determination, daring, nerve, chivalry

Hermione does things that indeed require a good amount of courage and bravery, but not without planning things before hand. She is very *resourceful* and focused on damage reduction, one could say *self-preserving* when doing something 

She is determined, which is also a Slytherin trait and has great *ambitions*

I'm unsure about the daring part. Hermione is willing to take risks to some extent, but as I said always focused on damage reduction.

Nerve is were it gets off. Sure, if you use it as a  synonym for courage it would still be fitting, but I rather interpret it as bold so I don't have 3 traits that basically come down to the same thing. Hermione is usually more subtle when she acts, though.

Chivalry and Hermione don't go well together at all. I've spent a good amount of time checking definitions of chivalry and it all boils down to honor and nobility in addition to 10 historical rules about defending the church. The issue is that Hermione does not fight fair or honorable. Stealing ingredients to make poly juice potion and spy on others is not honorable or noble. Attacking someone with magical birds out of jealousy is not noble. Making people sign a list without telling them it is hexed is not noble.


Hufflepuff: hard-working, patience, fairness, just, loyalty, modesty

Hard-working checks out, it very much alignes with the *determination* and *ambition* mentioned earlier.

Hermione is not necessarily patient. Sure, she rather takes longer to do something when this means the odds of succeeding are higher that way, but generally she is not patient. She acts rather annoyed when things take to long for her liking or others don't understand things she considers rather obvious.

I already mentioned that Hermione doesn't really fight fair. Of course you can argue that the ends justify the means, but that doesn't change anything about this.

Hermione has a strong sense of justice and morals, but what she considers to be just is basically what allignes with her personal agenda. If something doesn't fit her point of view she barely listens to the other person for example when Ron came back in DH or when she participated in bullying Fleur at the Burrow in HBP.

Hermione is loyal to her friends, unless she attacks them with magical birds because her feelings are hurt. 

Modesty is also not Hermione's strength. Sure, she doesn't gloat about always coming out on top of her class but her know-it-all attitude is not really modest.


Ravenclaw: wit, learning, wisdom, acceptance, intelligence, creativity

Wit, learning, wisdom and intelligence match perfectly, after all Hermione is supposed to be the brains of the group. This is also the reason many people say she should have been in Ravenclaw. 

Acceptance is one of this aspects that partially fit as long as certain conditions are met. Hermione is accepting, especially of people and magical beings that are discriminated against in the wizarding society. However, she is not accepting of different points of view or certain people who intend no harm (Fleur, Luna, Trewlawney). As soon as something doesn't fit her narrative the acceptance stops.

Creativity is also not her strength. She religiously sticks to what is written in the books. For example she saw that the altered recipes in the book of the HBP worked better than the ones in the book, but instead of investigating them she instantly refused to accept anything that is related to the book.


Slytherin: resourcefulness, determination, pride, cunning, ambition, self-preservation

Resourcefulness is one of Hermione's strengths. She is a quick thinker and able to make detailed plans to achieve her goals. The part where she led Umbridge to the forest in OotP is a good example for this.

Determination and ambition are also very prominent traits of her. When she has a goal she focuses on reaching it and works incredibly hard for it. She has the ambition to make magical Britain a better places for everyone, S.P.E.W. is a perfect example for this. Despite everyone telling her it's stupid she continued to work on it.

Hermione is very prideful, her attacking Ron out of jealousy is a perfect example for this. Her pride was hurt by him making out with Lavender.

Hermione is one of the most cunning characters in the entire series. The DA's list in OotP, the poly juice potion in CoS, setting Snape on fire in PS, catching Rita Skeeter in the jar in GoF and blackmailing her or confunding McLaggen in HBP are just some examples.

Self-preservation is not as obvious, but Hermione doesn't act reckless. She is usually very much aware of what she can get away with and acts accordingly.

So, this was only going through the lists of traits associated with each house, but there is more.

In PS the sorting hat sings:

 *those cunning folks use any means to achieve their ends*

This is basically Hermione. She has good intentions, but the way she tries to get to her goal are often not that honorable. This is not really shown to the reader, because Hermione usually proven right in what she does, even if it is objectively shitty behavior. Confunding McLaggen so that Ron makes the cut for the team? He turns out to be a massive douche later on. Letting Crookshanks hunt Scabbers? Scabbers turns out to be an evil wizard. Hating the HBP's book? There is dark magic written in it. Hexing the DA's list to **permanently** disfigure a potential snitch? Marietta rats them out.

Hermione only sticks to the rules when they don't interfere with her own agenda. When they don't she doesn't care for them. 


TL;DR If Hermione's parents had been magical, she would have ended up in Slytherin. The only reason she didn't is that JKR needed an evil house for pureblood supremacists and she needed to be in Gryffindor for plot convenience.The only reason Hermione was sorted into Gryffindor was plot convenience"

1,"Hi Potterheads!

I have a question for you. What informations are wizarding children (not muggle raised) expected to have before starting Hogwarts?

Common plants used in Herbology and their care? Common potion ingredients, their use and conservation, the basic techniques and the tool used in potion making? The basic of using a wand and a broom and their maintenance? Basic history of magic?

Or even the most basics informations were given the first weeks to get all the children to start on the same level?

I'm planning a Pre-Hogwarts education story so I'll appreciate your feedback!

Thank you

1,"So I'm in the middle of a re-read of the series, and I've had something of an epiphany.

It's already been established that Harry couldn't see the thestrals before witnessing Cedric's death, even though he was present for Lily's murder. This was because although Harry \*technically\* saw death, he was too young to really understand what he'd seen and internalize it. In order for someone to see a thestral, they need to really *know* that they've seen death in order for the change to take place. Since Harry was exactly 15 months old at the time, he certainly didn't know what the heck was going on.

And yet, as we see in POA, Harry certainly appears to have a vivid recollection of that fateful Halloween night. Well, at least he seems to remember the words that were spoken, as well as the flash of green light of the curse. In fact, Harry's recollection of the conversation is really quite remarkable for a 15-month-old child. He remembers everything that James, Lily, and Voldemort said, word-for-word - even words that a child his age probably wouldn't know yet. He doesn't just remember tones, snatches of words, or garbled sounds - he remembers the whole conversation with perfect clarity.

How is this possible? I don't think it is.

I believe that the ""memory"" Harry experiences in POA whenever the dementors approach him is actually the memory of the Horcrux within him. That is to say, this is really the memory that Voldemort has of that fateful night. Since the Harry-Horcrux was made that very night, that memory would be fresh in the ""mind"" of that bit of Voldemort's soul. 

Before Harry understands what's happening in that memory, he seems to be reacting to it as an outsider, and is distressed that a woman is about to be killed. He put the pieces together and figured out that the woman screaming was, in fact, his own mother. But he didn't recognize that memory as his own - probably because it wasn't really his own memory. Prior to his first dementor encounter, Harry's only memory of that night was just a flash of green light, which would make sense, because he was only 15 months old.

When the dementors first encountered Harry, they probably recognized that Harry had a bit more soul than the average person, and began to try and ""eat"" that piece of soul, finding it irresistible. Once the dementors first touched that Horcrux soul-piece within Harry, I think that's when the connection between Harry, the Horcrux, and Voldemort was ""activated."" All of a sudden, Harry is able to remember something he shouldn't really be able to remember. It just so happens that this memory is the last thing the Voldemort soul piece would have remembered. And less than a year later, Harry began having strange visions involving Voldemort, seemingly happening in real time.

Coincidence? I think not!Harry's ""memory"" of James's and Lily's deaths"

1,"Ok hear me out. If you think about it, wizards and witches have had magic for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Muggles have had to create and invent things that are non magical to overcome situations. Wizards and witches can use magic to solve most problems, meaning they are not as versatile as muggles if they have no magic. So even though all their magical stuff is impressive to us, comparatively it is not as impressive as the non magical solutions we have come up with.Are Muggles smarter/more versatile than wizards?"

1,I always wondered that R.A.B. was such a Voldemort supporter and at last still changed sides. I know the obvious answer would be that what he had done to Kreacher and etc. But still he changed sides and how did he find out about the horcruxes. This still is a question in my mind.What happened to R.A.B. to make him change sides. How did R.A.B. know that an equal match to Voldemort will rise. How did he know about the Horcruxes.

1,"We know Ron inherited Scabbers from Percy. However, it was never explained how or at what point Percy's real pet rat was replaced by Pettigrew.

Peter Pettigrew fled into the sewer as a rat while being chased by Sirius. At some point Pettigrew must have left the sewer, found Percy, noticed he had a pet rat, switched places (or discreetly killed off the real rat), and took on the identity of Scabbers. 

I'm curious how Pettigrew went from a muggle sewer to the Weasley home. Any ideas?At what point did Peter Pettigrew replace the real Scabbers (and how)?"
1,After re reading the books with my son we decided to watch a couple of the films. I bought them on iTunes and after finishing them realised there were loads of scenes missing.

1,"While re-watching CoS tonight, I recalled that the physical altercation between Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy from the book is reduced to a verbal showdown in the movie. 

I really wish they would’ve at least tussled a little bit in the film version. 

The crowd reaction in the book is especially fantastic. 

One of the twins, in response to Molly’s scolding of her husband for fighting in front of Gilderoy Lockhart, says “He was pleased. He was asking the Daily Prophet reporter to work the fight into the story.”

That bit always makes me crack up.Arthur Weasley vs. Lucius Malfoy in CoS"
1,"Last summer, I did an experiment where I listened to the books all at the same time in chapter order. So, I'd read all chapters one in order, then all chapters 2 in order, and so on. It was mostly to try the series out in a new way as I've probably read each book once a year since each came out.

One major takeaway: it was interesting to see the growth of the characters as the series develops and the shift in tone. I assumed that the characters would get darker and the tone as well. Actually, in many ways, especially in the last three books, there's more humor than you would expect. The books get more concrete in the use of magic, as well. The latter books deal with how magic functions and less just a whimsical world full of quirky notes of wonder. It never gets as concrete or analytical as I would like, but that's just my taste.

It was also interesting to see how the first two chapters or so were vastly different. In the first three books, there's a heavier emphasis on readers who have never read the books, including in the second and third book a ""this is Harry Potter, a wizard who goes to Hogwarts, a school of magic"" whereas the next books don't even start with Harry at all or start with him without any prelude and just assume the reader is experienced. The amount of time we spend with him at the Dursleys varies quite a bit in each book.

What I had hoped was to see a lot of those connections develop over the story by layering it on top of itself. Instead, it seems more like a bunch of disparate interesting ideas that sometimes connect when convenient but don't always work well together. There are tonal and world inconsistencies galore. As with many building stories (I'm looking at you, Supernatural), some of the worldbuilding gets outright retconned if it doesn't fit the needs of the story in the moment. Magic is a means of telling a story and the world gets less realistic but more interesting as it builds out. That's a much more obvious flaw when looking at all of the chapters together and seeing how the world is depicted. It doesn't scale well, though I prefer the larger, more diverse world of the later books to the more insular, smaller world of the first few books.

It's also glaringly obvious that the fourth book is the bridge. There is one world in the first three books and a different world in the last three books. It's why I think the fourth is so divisive. It has to connect worlds that really don't work well together (the first three books develop a Hogwarts that is too small to support the world of the last three books). 

Anyway, I'd recommend giving this a try. It changed my understanding of the series for good and bad.Read all seven books at the same time"

He'd have had no idea Ron and Harry were friends, so he wouldn't have headed there for that. He would have headed there to see if his godson was alright. His love for Harry literally trumped his one reason to bother staying alive and escaping.   
Also, considering the fact that Lily and James were in hiding by the time they had Harry, this is the first time Sirius has ever set eyes on the boy.... who looks exactly like his best friend... It must have been the most surreal moment.Sirius' first 'to do' after escaping Azkaban"

And then in the beginning of the next chapter, Neville tells Aberforth that a bunch of people will be Apparating directly to the bar. Later on in the book, underage Hogwarts students are shepherded to the bar so they can go home to safety.

1,"There are so many great Ron Weasley moments. My favorite moment is the chess match.

Maybe it's a basic favorite, but it really showcases Ron's personality. We learn how strategic his is when he beats the chess set. We can see him be confident for once, and know that this is an area that nobody overshadows him in.

We also see Ron's selflessness. He was willing to sacrifice himself for not only his friends, but the fate of the wizarding world.

“Yes. . .” said Ron softly, “it's the only way . . . I've got to be taken.”

“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.

“That's chess!” snapped Ron. “You've got to make some sacrifices! I'll make my move and she'll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!”

“But —”

“Do you want Snape or not?”

“Ron —”

“Look, if you don't hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!”

There was nothing else for it.

“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go — now don't hang around once you've won.”

He stepped forward and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard around the head with her stone ark and he crashed to the floor — Hermione screamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out.”

I like this scene the most because this kid is only eleven, and he's doing things adults would never do! All three got chances to prove themselves in that chapter, but Ron's was by far the best.

Anyone who says Ron is a coward, or not good enough for the trio needs to read the same books I did.


Honorable mentions include:

Any funny remark that cheers Harry up. (including calling him on the “fellytone""

When he stands up on one foot to tell Sirius that he'll have to kill him before Harry.

When he is the one brave enough to apologize to Harry in the Goblet of Fire.

When he returns in the Deathly Hallows.

When the “Weasley is Our King"" song is turned into a Gryffindor version.

When he first kisses Hermione

When he first meets Harry

And lastly, when he tells Harry that he'll be there to support him the whole time at the end of the Half Blood Prince.

I could go on and on about how much Ron has done for his friends. I don't get how people can sit there and bash him.

Ron is arguably the most underrated character in Harry Potter.What is your favorite Ron Weasley moment?"

That is at least 14 periods she and every other main teacher had to keep straight. How in the fuck did they manage that, it is absolutely insane. Plus if there are at most 4 periods in a day (hogwarts does block schedule) some periods only meet once a week. I could never keep track of all that holy crap.

Instead of going to the Halloween feast that year, Harry, Ron, and Hermione went to Nick’s Death Day party. While there, we are introduced, from a distance, to Moaning Myrtle. Hermione explains to Ron and Harry that Myrtle is why she won’t use the girl’s bathroom on the second floor. Peeves overhears her account of Myrtle’s behavior, and ushers Myrtle over. Peeves then uses Hermione’s words to bully Myrtle from the party. 


It’s after this that they leave, Harry hears the basilisk, and they find Mrs. Norris. 


The only reason Mrs. Norris wasn’t killed that night was because of the flooding in the hallway— which Myrtle caused by blowing up her bathroom pipes. If Hermione hadn’t gone to the party, hadn’t been overheard by Peeves, and hadn’t upset Myrtle enough to leave and flood the bathroom, Mrs. Norris would have died.


So that’s a +2 for Hermione (including Penelope Clearwater) not counting everyone she saved indirectly after the fact by deducing it was a Basilisk in the walls.Hermione (along with Myrtle and Peeves) inadvertently saved Mrs. Norris from death in CoS"

Who would win in a duel between the chosen one's best friends, Hermione vs Ron, duel starts with them facing each other 5 m apart with no other weapons wearing a T-shirt and jeans.

Most people I knew are Hermione fans but turns out a lot of people on the internet like Ron so this thread might go either way

Personally I believe Ron would win, I've said it before, knowledge vs power, Hermione might know more spells and can use non-verbal curses. But I believe Ron has better feats in actual fights, most people who support Hermione usually talk about how she saved the trio multiple times and is insanely smart, but Hermione saving the duo never included beating anyone in a duel.

But Ron has pretty impressive battle feats, like fighting multiple death eaters in the ministry (Luna said ""them"" so I can infer he fought multiple DE and won or tied since we don't see other death eaters come out the door) hit a wasp mid air and protected Tonks from Bellatrix and Rudolphus in mid air (Tonks even commended him) In the manor he also did well against Narcissa, Draco and being able to disarm Bellatrix. He also fought five snatchers of (possibly could have been three since two were apparently fighting each other when he fought back) and he reacted faster then Hermione in the cafe and saved her, she would have been taken out of the fight immediately if not for him. (This also proves is definitely faster then the two of them) i also want to point out that he did perform that slug spell verblessly, Ron also is physically fitter, which is helpful for dodging or just being able to close the gap and punch her. Hermione did fight Bellatrix but she had Ginny and Luna with her (who are both rather talented) and they still were losing. If the two fought I feel Ron would fire faster before Hermione could do any proper spell. 

What do you think?Hermione vs Ron who would win in a duel"

1,"So I have had this idea for a Potter TV series for years and never heard it brought up. I’m hoping if I put the idea out in the universe it will happen.

Title: The Founders

Plot: Hundreds of years before Harry fights he who must not be named for the fate of the wizarding world man kind is troubled by magical beasts and magic users are largely with out a community or a shared identity. The story follows the four Founders of Hogwarts in their quest to bring the witch’s and wizards of their world together for a shared purpose. However all four have very different motivations for their shared goal.

Let’s use this as a thread to share ideas on this write portions and grow this concept maybe we can get this made some dayHarry Potter TV series pitch!"

Moreover, what about book purists who did not watch the movies?

1,"For all the turd thrown JK Rowling's way about how horrible Voldemort is as a villain, I maintain that Albus Dumbledore is one of the most brilliantly written villains in all of fantasy fiction.

Order of the Phoenix and Deathly Hallows really showed how much of a villainous monster Albus Dumbledore really was...

First, Order of the Phoenix:

From:

&gt;*“Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well — not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle’s doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.”*

To...

&gt;*“Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now? I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could avoid, that I must avoid.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“I don’t —”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“I cared about you too much,” said Dumbledore simply. “I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“Is there a defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have — and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined — not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands.”*

To quote and paraphrase an awesome HP fanfic author summarizing Dumbledore's ""love"" for Harry in order to send him off to be a pig for slaughter. What Dumbledore essentially said was:

***“I concealed things from you because I loved you so much, and your innocent face just made me decide to lie and lie and lie to you. And you should be so grateful your aunt took you in and abused you for ten years, because at least you aren’t dead. And don’t you feel so guilty that people might have died because I loved you so much that I had to lie to you.”***

There also seems to be this desperate attempt to make Adolf Dumbledore - oh sorry, *Albus* Dumbledore - seem like some innocent hero doing horrible things to Harry because he cared. Are we really expected to believe that he cared? Cared so much that he didn't tell Harry the truth until after the only obstacle that could free Harry from his abusive relatives was 100% dead, he was head of the Wizengamot for years and apparently he felt nothing about Sirius Black being sent to prison without a trial nor opened-up any investigation for 13 years on a man being sent off to prison without due process, and *conveniently* Sirius Black happens to be free of all charges after his death once Dumbledore regains his status on the Wizengamot despite there still being no proof that Peter Pettigrew was alive. Dumbledore just conveniently gains the power to get Sirius's name cleared, so why not do it after the events of Prisoner of Azkaban? Because then, he'd lose the pawn needed to sacrifice himself for Dumbledore's Greater Good, of course.

It's quite clear that Dumbledore thinks himself infallible and all his plans to be infallible too. His arrogance is attested to in Half-blood Prince and Deathly Hallows:

&gt;“\[. . .\] being — forgive me — rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.” (Book 6, U.S. p. 197)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable.” (Book 6, U.S. p. 570)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“And at last, my brother \[Albus\] had an equal to talk to, someone just as bright and talented as he was.” (Book 7, U.S. p. 566)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution.” (Book 7, U.S. p. 716)

How humble! He seemed to think his flaws were loving too much, but I'd argue that it was his sheer arrogance. This man really seemed to think that he was infallible. Nowhere is this more clear than with Horcrux hunting; the level of stupidity in Dumbledore's plans is hilarious. First, in Order of the Phoenix, while mocking Sirius for not valuing his house elf Kreacher enough, right after Sirius's death no less!, Dumbledore makes a point saying how Wizards often underestimate the House-elves and overlook them. That's nice; too bad he does exactly that with Kreacher, no less! Presumably, he spent so many months researching the cave that Harry and he go to in Half-blood Prince, while paying no attention to Mundungus Fletcher's pilfering of 12 Grimmauld Place, which results in the very Horcrux Dumbledore sought to obtain enter into Dolores Umbridge's hands! The sheer incompetence is hilarious, yet the narrative and Dumbledore himself has you convinced that Dumbledore isn't a colossal idiot.

Let's talk about the other brilliant plan from Albus Dumbledore: Doing absolutely nothing to stop Draco Malfoy, resulting in Death Eaters like the Carrows, Greyback, and *Bellatrix fucking Lestrange entering Hogwarts and killing children.* What a brilliant move on almighty, infallible, goody-good guy Dumbledore! He cared for Draco's wellbeing so much that he let children die so he could potentially recruit another spy for his Order of the Phoenix! The same Order of the Phoenix that had a member illegally sell Black family heirlooms *and* a Horcrux. All because in the beginning of Book 6, Dumbledore convinced Harry Potter that it was for the ""Greater Good"" to let the Order of the Phoenix use Grimmauld Place.

Oh! Oh! Let's get to the *stupidest part* of Mr. Infallible's plans. He shows Harry a memory convincing Harry that a Horcrux is within the halls of Hogwarts hidden somewhere -- as if there's a Room of Hidden Things where they could find it -- and *does absolutely nothing to find the Horcrux that is within the Castle while taking a trip to a far off mountain with Harry to urgently find another Horcrux.* Apparently, Horcrux hunting is only urgent if it is outside of Hogwarts castle. Dumbledore and Harry are lucky that a Death Eater like Bellatrix didn't spot it, recognize it, and take it to return to Lord Voldemort since we know she knew about them and had one in the Lestrange vault.

But wait! It gets dumber and dumber! If Voldemort had simply cast the killing curse on Severus Snape in Book 7, then Dumbledore's harebrained schemes would have fallen apart and Harry wouldn't have known to sacrifice himself. And, by the way, Dumbledore postulating that Harry could come back - as some have claimed his ""look of triumph"" in book 4, Goblet of Fire, somehow implies despite it being so vague as to mean anything - the fact is that he had no way of knowing if Harry would survive or not. It never was tested before and at best, he could only speculate. So, no, he didn't send Harry ""knowing he'd survive"" as [some people fool themselves into believing]( he sent Harry without knowing what the consequences would be and being perfectly fine with the result of Harry dying for the Greater Good that he concocted in his head. Evidently, Harry Potter dying for the ""greater good"" is fine, but stopping Draco Malfoy before he brings Death Eaters to kill children isn't part of Dumbledore's ""greater good"" at all. People obsessed with ""proving"" that ""[Dumbledore loved Harry!!!]( are hilarious. Where was the love for Harry in Snape's memory in Book 7? He MOCKS Snape *specifically for having any compassion for Harry*. Is that love?

It is hilarious that people go on and on with mental gymnastics trying to pretend Albus Dumbledore was ever a good person. When shown a Tom Riddle living in an orphanage with a not-so-nice upbringing, he failed to do anything and actually *took the advice of an 11-year old Tom Marvolo Riddle* to let the kid wander to the Leaky Cauldron and Diagon Alley alone. Dumbledore's negligent behavior that puts children in danger extends as far back as at least that, even if we discount that he got his own sister murdered through his incompetence -- assuming he didn't kill her himself since he seems to like blaming everything on Grindelwald and scapegoating him while presenting himself as a blameless victim who was too ""in love"" and ""blinded"" by it. And notice this, he *immediately* believes Tom Riddle is evil at age 11. Only a true villain could project his own failings onto a child and say the child therefore born evil. Albus Dumbledore is one of the greatest villains and incompetent Headmasters in all of fantasy fiction.

1,So i joined a hp roleplay thing recently and im making a character and im conflicted whether she should be a metamorphmagus or an animagus. Ive been doing research on metamorphmagi and im kind of confused. Can they turn themselves into animals? Because i thought they could. But it seems they cant. But i have seen the thing where Tonks gave herself a duck bill and a pig snout. So theoretically if my character wanted could she give herself cat ears? Can she change her height a bit if shes morphing into someone else? Could she give herself horns? Could she give herself fangs? And could she change the colour of her eyes to someone unnatural such as purple?I have a question about metamorphmagi specifically regarding the extent of their ability
1,When your Best Friend and a Ghost are suddenly excited about Cat Tails
1,"So most consider the names cringe-worthy, and granted Harry had no lack of brilliant people he could of honoured who sacrificed everything but I think the names he chose are beautiful.

So starting with the first born, James Sirrius Potter -

James and Sirrius, two best friends, Harry's Father whom he never got to know and his Father's best friend who was as close to a Father figure as he had known. Both lived their life to the full together and would both of done anything Harry needed. A fitting name for his first born and an even fitter pairing of the two names.

Second born, Albus Severus Potter -

Albus and Severus, I think this relationship was one filled with a mutual respect and was very complex. They saw eachother at their worst and did things for one another that could only result in a bond. Albus and Harry's bond was one filled with love and admiration. Snape and Harry's bond was a complex one, some of Snape's actions towards Harry and in general are inexcusable, but Harry knows and accepts the role Snape played in the defeat of Voldermort and I think him putting Albus and Snape's name together when his relationship with the two, was so different, shows the respect and admiration Harry feels for Snape in the end and I imagine both Snape and Albus would be honoured with the pairing of their names.

Third born, Lily Luna Potter -

Lily and Luna, two completely different witches but two witches that were never afraid to speak it how it was. If they ever met, I imagine they would be great friends. Luna, like Harry had lost her mother. Luna was there for Harry in ways not even Ron or Hermione could be, this unlikely friendship was so pure. They truly would be their for eachother no matter what. Again a great and worthy pairing of names.Unpopular opinion: Harry named his children really beautifully."

1,"What are some parts of the Harry Potter books that you misunderstood when you read them for the first time, at a young age? Here are mine, from when I first read the books as a little kid:

1) I used to think that the reason Ginny behaved so strangely around Harry in CoS was that she was starstruck by him being a celebrity. I didn’t realize she had a crush on him.

2) I believed Rob when he said that his hostility towards Hermione and Krum was about: *”Fraternizing with the enemy.”* I didn’t realize it was romantic rivalry.

3) I thought that when Umbridge was using hand motions to communicate with Hagrid during his inspection, she was mocking him for, as she put it: *”Resorting to crude sign language”* when he mimed the thestrals having wings. I didn’t realize that this, along with the slow, loud voice she used, was about treating Hagrid like an idiot.

4) I always read Umbridge’s silly interrupting cough as her literally saying the words: *”Hem hem.”*

5) When Umbridge and her gang snuck up on Hagrid at midnight, I didn’t realize they were trying to actually attack him with force. I thought they were just sneaking up on him to fire him in private, in the middle of the night. The reason I thought this is that Ernie Macmillan speculated that Umbridge clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawny’s. She didn’t *attack* Trelawny, she just fired her in a way that caught a lot of attention, so from Ernie’s words I concluded that she was just doing the same thing to Hagrid in private. This was something that confused me. I didn’t really get how a sacking suddenly escalated into a full-blown fight, or why this was a horrible enough method of sacking to infuriate Hermione so much.

6) I didn’t realize that “Won-Won” was Lavender’s mushy way of saying the name “Ron.” It sounded so much like “Wonton” that I honestly thought it was something Asian. Needless to say, I was very confused by that part.

But just imagine, he gets tired of being everyones hero and decides to become the next Lord Voldemort. What objects would he use as horcruxes? Voldemort has choosen symbolic things and stuff thats important to him. I have some ideas for Harry:

- the Ford Anglia, a car that freed him from the Dursleys, brought him to his beloved school and saved him from the spiders
- the Firebolt, Harrys favourite broom
- the mirror he got from Sirius 
- the Goblet of Fire, since it symbolizes the tri wizard tournament where Harry won and where his ""real"" fight against his greatest enemy, Voldemort, started 
- the golden snitch, no need to explain
- Godric Griffyndors sword, since it saved him several times and is the object of the founder of his house

""What's that?"" said Ron, pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large steak-and-kidney pudding.

""It's French,"" said Hermione, ""I had it on holiday summer before last. It's very nice.""

Other than the obvious very funny sneezing joke, I also thought it was hilarious that Ron was turned off by the bouillabaisse but then proceeded to eat blooding pudding.

1,I used the incorrect quotes generator on the golden trio and I don't regret it
1,"We know from both the book and the movie that Professor Snape and Igor Karkaroff had at least 1 heated exchange over their dark marks burning again. 

We know that Karkaroff is a slimy dishonest ex-death eater who’s becoming increasingly panicked, fearing what would happen to him as he betrayed Lord Voldemort and many of his fellow followers. The last thing he wants is Voldemort’s return. 

We know that Snape is ultimately one of the good guys, and that also the last thing he wants is Voldemort’s return, but for much more genuine reasons. Because Snape is a double agent for us, he would’ve told Dumbledore if he heard the slightest bit of anything about Moody/Crouch Jr’s scheming. 

We can assume that Snape knew nothing of the plot and hence, Dumbledore knew nothing of it either, allowing the 3rd task to proceed. 

**The Night Of The Third Task From Snape &amp; Dumbledore’s Perspective**

• The contestants disappear into the maze. 

• Fleur Delacour is rescued from the maze. Upon seeing the red sparks, Snape and Dumbledore can infer that a contestant is in need of rescue. That’s all they know. Once Fleur is bought out by a team of rescuers... Potter, Diggory, and Krum are left. 

• Viktor Krum is rescued from the maze. Upon seeing the red sparks, Snape and Dumbledore can infer that a contestant is in need of rescue. That’s all they know. Once Viktor is bought out of the maze by a team of rescuers, Potter and Diggory are left. This means that Hogwarts will win the Triwizard Tournament no matter what. The Hogwarts crowd members must be feeling excitement at this news. 

**Here is the part I wonder about**

**At some point between Krum’s rescue and Harry’s return with Cedric’s corpse, Voldemort summoned all death eaters by pressing the dark mark upon Wormtail’s arm.**

**Being a carrier of the dark mark, surely Snape would’ve felt it too. Does he recognize that Lord Voldemort had returned? Or does he brush it off as just nagging pain that’s become more consistent over the past few months?** 

**As we know that Snape is a good guy, if he was certain that Voldemort have returned, he would’ve immediately informed Dumbledore and they would’ve located all students and saved Harry sooner.**

**Knowing this it’s safe to assume that Snape did not sense Voldemort’s return, or if he did, he did not inform Dumbledore or answer the call as it would blow his cover as a loyal servant of Voldemort to Voldemort.** 

**It just doesn’t really add up to me. But perhaps that’s just me.**

Either way,

• Harry returns from the Maze clutching Cedric’s dead body and the Triwizard Cup. Nobody has any clue what just happened. 

Snape must be having a sense of “What the hell? Holy sh-t!” that everyone else is feeling. 

In his head he’s probably now connecting the dots between the searing pain coming from his dark mark and the fact that there’s a dead Triwizard Champion in front of him. 

He’s probably feeling shock. 

• Dumbledore becomes suspicious of “Moody” after he disobeys an order from him and takes Harry up to his office. Snape and McGonagall are informed of this suspicion and they immediately rush to save Harry. “Moody” is then revealed as Crouch Jr and spills his entire story. 

By this point Snape must be connecting all the dots from the major events of the last 13 years, especially the last 9 months, with Crouch’s testimony. 

What are Snape’s possible thoughts continuing from this point forward? Here’s some of my hypotheticals: 

Within an hour his life changed and his own fate was essentially sealed:

• “Hogwarts as an institution will not be the same going forward. Such ramifications include ministry interference and a lack of support from the wizarding community considering our massive security breach. Many students will not likely think of Hogwarts as having a sense of safety anymore.” 

• Despite his poker face and stoicism, he must feel shock and sadness that one of his own young students just up and sudden died.

What does Lord Voldemort’s return mean for Snape personally?

• It certainly means 1000% higher stress levels. 

• His own life is more at risk (Considering he is killed by Voldemort a mere 3 years later). 

• In the back of his mind it becomes increasingly clear his fate is close too, as Voldemort is back and he know’s he’s going to be Dumbledore’s pawn as far as spying on him for the Order as well as laying down his own life at some point or another. 

• This ^ will involve destroying his own reputation and dignity completely. 

• He now has to go to Voldemort directly, seeing as he wasn’t present when Voldemort initially summoned all of his death eaters. This will certainly involve a chewing out over why Snape didn’t look for him when he was first vanquished, as well as a full report card on Dumbledore and Harry’s plans and schemes over the past 13 years. 

• After that, Snape must contact other Order members to assist Dumbledore in immediately creating a resistance ASAP 

If I were in Snape’s shoes I would’ve had a nice long nap and snack fest after initially dealing with all of that.

Towards the end of the book, after Harry shows Dumbledore the cut on his arm where Wormtail had cut him:

“For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore’s eyes. The next second he was sure he had imagined it, for when Dumbledore had returned to sit behind the desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry had ever seen him.”

What does this mean? Am I reading too much into this? Why would J.K. Rowling have put this short sentence about Harry thinking he saw triumph in Dumbledore’s eyes when Dumbledore looked at the cut if it simply meant nothing?

I could be reading too much into it but I feel as though if it meant nothing it wouldn’t be there. 

I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

1,"I’ve been a big Harry Potter fan since my parents first took me to see Sorcerer’s stone when it first came out (I was 7, I am 26 now). I saw the next few movies in theaters as well and when I was about 10 I started reading the series. 

At age 13 my health took a serious turn for the worst. It took a whole year and a half to diagnose me. During that time and for several years after, while I was struggling to remain healthy, I always leaned on the books/movies for some stability. I don’t know why I was so drawn to them, but any hospital stay guaranteed an HP marathon. Any time I was bedridden at home I would pick up an HP book. I was so comforted by immersing myself in the world. 

Here I am, many years later and still dealing with some mental health trauma from that time in my life. I still rely on Harry Potter to bring me comfort. I am rereading the series and I love escaping into the wizardry world. It’s beautiful and sad and extremely happy and even scary sometimes. I am forever thankful for Harry Potter because I truly don’t know how I would’ve gotten through the hard times without it.Just wanted to share my Harry Potter experience..."
1,"**Andromeda Tonks**: Grew up in the darkest of households yet never lost her light. Fell in love and married a Muggle Born, was chucked out of her family. Gave birth to a wonderful daughter in Tonks and instilled in her a strong moral code. Accepted a werewolf who was much older than her daughter as her son-in-law and took them in. Didn't break down when her husband was killed, instead chose to be strong for her daughter and her unborn child. During the Great Battle, chose to stay behind with her grandson even when every fibre in her body must have been shouting for revenge. Took care of her grandson after his parents' death.
 
**Kreacher**: Forgotten, left on his own in an empty house with a painting of his mad mistress for company, pining for some love and respect, finally gets it from Harry. His rallying cry at the Battle of Hogwarts was a testament to how far he had come.

**Lavender Brown**: Carefree, sentimental, a bit silly but generally a happy go lucky teenager whose problems should have been boys and grades. She just wanted to live a normal life but when the battle reared its ugly teeth, she chose to fight along with her schoolmates. The saddest part was that she was murdered by mutilation by Greyback. It wasn't even a quick death either. She suffered so much and it was one of the most depressing arcs of the series.

**Grawp**: Shunned by his community for not being exactly like them. Rescued by his half brother but had to stay hidden almost during his entire time in the Forest. Knew just Harry and Hermy apart from Hagrid during his stay. Forced to flee to the mountains again when the Death Eaters took over. But he proved his worth in the Battle. Going against the much stronger, taller and experienced Giants he fought tooth and nail. Ultimately he got what he was looking for the entire time. Acceptance. The students were laughing and throwing food at his face. He became a part of Hogwarts. 

**Firenze**: Was one of those who played a key role albeit from the shadows in keeping Harry safe. Rescued him from the Forest in his first year from Quirrell/Voldemort when he was all alone. Always stood firm in his decision to help the light even when his community were openly staying away from what was written in the stars. Helps Dumbledore at the cost of being shunned from his community when Umbridge was about to get rid of Trelawney and keeps the prophecy from falling into the wrong hands. Fights hard in the great battle. 

**Colin Creevey**: The first real 'fan' of Harry who was often in amazement of the BWL. The unofficial photographer of Harry's world, he often found himself in a sticky situation due to his over-enthusiasm, like getting petrified by the Basilisk. He was one of those people who never wavered in their loyalty towards Harry. He even got some of Malfoy's *Support Cedric Diggory* badges and tried to charm them to say *Support Harry Potter* but failed miserably. He was one of the original members of the DA. He had to go in hiding after Voldemort's return but snuck in during the Great Battle. He was killed in the process but till his dying breath, he was utterly and completely loyal to Harry. 

**Madame Maxime**: Although much is not known about the Beauxbatons Headmistress, but from what we know, she was brave and loyal to a fault. She could have stayed away as it was not her fight when Dumbledore asked for her help with the Giants. She went on a very dangerous mission and later kept Hagrid's brother a secret when he asked her to. 

**Oliver Wood**: Everyone's favourite keeper. He lived and breathed Quidditch. When Professor McGonagall entrusted him to teach an eleven-year-old a game he has never played before and train him up to be the youngest seeker in a century, he wasn't fazed. Instead, he taught Harry everything he knew. He was a special talent. Being the Quidditch captain in his fourth year was no mean feat. He was a maniac in the way he held training, ran tactics and wore down everyone with his single-minded determination to win the elusive Quidditch Cup which he did manage in his final year. He signed professionally. Later he responded to Hogwarts cry for help in the Great Battle and helps to defend the castle and Harry. He helped Neville carry Colin after his death. 

**Aberforth Dumbledore**: Faded, jaded, frustrated and a whole more discontent with the world, that was him when he had his first real conversation with Harry just before the Battle. But he wasn't always like that. A lifetime ago he was a devoted brother to his little sister, a kind soul, often being overshadowed by his more talented and illustrious brother but he was happy in his little world. But that life came crashing down and he lost everyone he held dear within a very short period. Father, mother, little sister and brother. He blamed Albus for Ariana's death and they never recovered from that. Even though they called a truce with him taking over Hog's Head but the family he held so dear was lost. He tried to be cold, unassuming but his kindness still seeped through. He kept an eye on Harry in his limited capacity, sent Dobbie when Harry needed him the most, helped Neville and the Hogwarts students in the Room of Requirements with food and information, managed to save Harry just before the battle, served as an apparition port for the battle and he joined in it. His was one of the most complicated and melancholic stories in the entire series.

**UPDATE 1**

**Kingsley Shacklebolt**: The man is a member of a family on the Sacred 28 but acted like a Muggle so well, he guards the Prime Minister. He's one of the best Aurors and is one of the Order's best men. After the war, he enacts progressive measures to try and fix wizarding Britain's wrongs. He also can tell Umbridge to calm down and also impresses Vernon Dursley of all people.The Harry Potter universe is magnificent with so many characters with their own stories. But I have come to think that a lot of characters are often cast into the shadows behind their more lustrous counterparts. But they deserve recognition. I'll try in that regard. Please feel free to add more."
1,Me and my friends all have our own list of best characters but we don’t agree whether Sirius or Lupin is better. I go back and forth myself. So what is it?Sirius or Lupin?
1,"If JKR edited her books and fixed some of the contradictions and loopholes (examples below), would you read them? Do you think this is something authors should do? I'm talking edits beyond typos, but they would not change the overall plot or storyline. 

JKR did this once (to my knowledge): The first edition of GoF is written incorrectly when Harry's parents come out of Voldemort's wand in the grave yard. Editions 2+ have them edited to come out in the correct order. [Wand Order Problem (HP Lexicon)](

**Note:** Let's forget the JKR is a problematic human for the sake of the discussion.

*Contradictions &amp; Plotholes (non-exhaustive):*

* The missing 24 hours (between the death of Harry's parents and when Hagrid brings him to the Dursley's)
* The Trace, this thing is so confusing and poorly explained.
* The DADA job being cursed, the twins should mention that Quirrell is new to DADA in book 1, minimally. The first few books makes it seem like this curse is new, but in HBP, it is explained as a long curse, since Voldemort applied for the position. 
* Time inaccuracies (Dudley's playstation, etc.)
* Fred &amp; George never saw Peter on the Map (might be hard to fix this)

And JKR has been quoted multiple times saying she wishes she edited OotP more.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you think? If you would read them, what do you want edited?Would you want updated/fixed Harry Potter Books?"

1,"Hi, I'm a non native english speaker, so sorry for any mistakes. Also reading in my native tongue, so I try to get the translation right.

Currently re-reading the series and in the fifth book, right after Ron gets his prefect badge, the twins apparate to his and Harrys room to discuss the new DADA book and wonder who the new teacher is. At this point Fred said they twins had heard that Dumbledore had problems finding a new teacher for DADA. George answered with saying something like ""No wonder, when considering what happened to the last FOUR teachers.""

Harry then counted the teachers that one was fired (Lupin), one died (Quirrell), one lost his memory (Lockhart) and one was locked 9 months in his own trunk (Moody).

So, was George just like ""Ah, Harry's just been 4 years so no need to talk about the rest."" at this point?

It may very well be that noone of them thought about the teachers before Harrys time, but I really find it hard to believe as George was the one talking about 4 teachers, as he had at that point studied for 6 years. The assumed DADA curse was placed during Voldys visit with Dumbledore, which I think took place in -71 (someone could fact check this please?) so even if the Weasleys didn't know about the curse at least they very obviously should notice that one teacher was different every year.

And if the 4 teachers that Harry had are anything to go by, the other teachers that the twins (or older Weasleys) had must have had some disturbed things happening to them, and I don't believe that Fred and George would pass up on the chance to at least freak out Ron, if not Harry, like they did with the sorting ceremony.Was George just considerate when talking about the DADA teachers?"
1,"Does anyone else get a little headache at around about the middle to the end of the book? Around about the chapter "" Occlumency "" to "" Snapes Worst Memory "". Here's why I certainly do.

The first is Harry, not even beginning to try to practice Occlumency, which don't forget, ended up somewhat directly to Sirius' death, and eventually the removal of Fudge and the truth about Voldemort. He just seems very very petulant, saying he doesn't like the visions, yet almost certainly wants to see more. And doesn't try at all to prevent that. Moving quickly on.

Harry deciding to jump into Snape's memories. I wonder how that could go wrong. I find it very hard to sympathise for Harry sometimes, especially at this moment, jumping into Snape's memories yet crying when Snape insults him. 

Don't get me wrong, Snape started it all, but come on.

Anyone else agree ? Or is it my 5AM frustration getting to me 🤣Order Of The Phoenix"

1,"I have heard many complaints about Harry's name choices for his children. I for one definitely agree that Minerva deserved to have a child named after her. However, some of the names people often suggest are already taken by others, though I suppose repeats would be fine:

Teddy's middle name is Remus.

One of Percy's children was named after Molly.

Rose Weasley was named after Rubeus Hagrid.

George named a child after Fred.

and probably more.

What do you think? Would you change the names Harry gave his children? (especially 'Albus Severus'. Something tells me James would not have approved of a grandson with that middle name.)What would you have named Harry's children instead?"

1,"[There’s no direct English translation for hygge, but the word evokes both coziness and togetherness. “It’s not just cozy with a blanket and a glass of wine,” Kurtz tells Quartz. “It’s also interpersonally cozy—so having a few people with you talking about issues and things you care deeply about. Having some candles lit, maybe a nice warm drink in your hand. Feeling safe and content.”](

IMO, hygge is the defining characteristic of Harry Potter. It’s what resonates among the fans and what the haters just don’t get when they criticize the series. More important than the plot or the prose or the characters is this feeling that Rowling evokes. Yes it’s related to the major themes (friendship, love, etc.) but it goes beyond that. It permeates the story, from the Leaky Cauldron to the Hogwarts Express to  the Gryffindor Common Room to Hagrid’s hut to the Burrow. 

Why and how do you think Rowling is so successful at creating this feeling? What are some examples from the books or movies that give you a sense of hygge?What are your favorite examples of “hygge” in the series?"
1,"Remember the original Slytherin Quidditch team seeker in the first movie? What could've happened to him that Malfoy ended up taking his place the year after?

Or maybe Malfoy's bribery caused him to have to leave?

Or maybe he just simply left by his own accord for his own reasons?Whatever happened to the original Slytherin seeker?"

I’m actually shocked how how much information is cut from this one for the movie.  I know they can’t have everything in the movie.  But this one by far is the biggest difference so far.   The movie really lacked in portraying how Harry was feeling through the summer and over the school year.  It was downplayed a lot in the movie.    The fear and hatred and confusion and the curiosity Harry was feeling.  That barely came through in the movie.     This felt like a good place to vent about it since nobody I know is into Harry Potter 🤷‍♂️.    Just bought my copy of the half blood prince.   Can’t wait to start reading it.Poor Dobby."
1,"Hi, I’m Dakky and I live in England, therefore I have only ever seen the Philosopher’s Stone version of the first Harry Potter movie.

Tonight, through my TV’s subscription service (which seems to be American), I watched ‘The Sorcerer’s Stone’ for the first time whilst waiting for my girlfriend to return home from work.

I wasn’t expecting anything different because, as far as I was aware, the only difference between the two movies was the title-

But whilst watching it I noticed that there were a few scenes that I simply hadn’t seen before.

At first, when I saw Petunia cracking eggs and removing Hogwarts letters from inside them, I chalked it up to being tired (it’s currently nearly 3am for me)...

But then, when I arrived at the scene where Hagrid is talking to Harry on the London Underground, I knew something was up.

I had definitely never seen these scenes before.

I didn’t want any more new scenes to be ruined, so I didn’t look anything up and just continued to watch the movie.

In total I think there were 6 scenes I noticed that were different. I noticed a few lines had also been added here and there because, of course, they can’t say ‘Philosopher’s Stone’ in a movie called ‘The Sorcerer’s Stone’, can they?
What I mean is, these were fully fledged new scenes that I was never aware of (other than one where Ron comforts Harry about the Mirror of Erised, which I had previously thought was a deleted scene)

I believe a few of these scenes actually helped with the continuity of the plot - like Hagrid telling Harry that he’d always wanted a dragon and then getting one makes much more sense than in Philosopher’s where he just kind of gets one out of the blue.

I don’t know if these are actual scenes that were added to Sorcerer’s and not Philosopher’s or if I somehow have an extended version, but I suppose my real question here is did anyone else know about these differences? Or am I just a poor excuse for a HP fan? Haha!

I won’t link the videos I took of my screen as I was watching through a streaming service and therefore don’t technically own the rights to show people parts of the movie, I don’t think... [Rule #3: No enabling piracy]
either way, I don’t want to be told off for sharing anything, but I can give more info about the scenes I found if anyone else didn’t know about them!

Any comments on this/discussions are appreciated as I’ve found it very interesting!

1,"I’m of the opinion that the books are pretty much intact as they are but I’m curious to hear what’s one minor amendment/addition/subtraction that you would make to them if you could!

Personally, I would have liked for Flitwick and Sprout to have been official members of the Order rather than nominal/honorary ones (full disclaimer: I’m a Ravenclaw so vested interests...). I think it would have better mirrored the fact that there are Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff students in the DA if we think of how the DA is the successor of the Order.One minor (inconsequential?) change you would make to the books?"

Pureblood + Half-blood = Half-blood

Half-blood + Half-blood = Half-blood

Pureblood + Muggleborn = Half-blood

Muggleborn + Muggleborn = ??

It wouldn't be 'Muggleborn' because the definition of 'Muggleborn' is a magical child of two non-magical parents. Therefore the magical child of two muggleborns can't be labeled as muggleborn. It wouldn't make sense for them to be half-blooded as well since there's no 'half'. Would they be a first generation pureblood? However I highly doubt the pureblood elitists would recognize a child of two 'mudbloods' as their equal.

1," I'm sure if you've ever watched a TV show with a psychic, 99% of the time they make the prophecy come true simply by hearing it and trying to make it NOT happen; which I think is the case in Harry Potter. 

If the prediction hadn't been made, Voldemort never would have had a reason to go after the potters and snape would never have asked him to spare Lilly: Harry never would have had the protection his mother gave him, so how would he have the power of "" Neither can live while the other survives"" that would have later destroyed Voldemort? 

Which also leads me to; how in the world would have Neville been involved if it wasn't harry? In the books Harry wonders if neville would be sitting across from him with a scar on his head... but that leads back to the fact Voldemort would have just blasted the entire family without asking them to step aside three times first like he did with Lilly on snapes request. 

 If snape had overheard and voldemort decided to go after the Longbottoms, I doubt snape would have asked to spare nevilles mom, giving neville a chance at having the deep magically protection that would have caused. 

This leads me to thinking that if the prediction had never been made, Voldemort would have never accidently created a weapon against himself.Book 5; If snape had never heard the prophecy, how would it have come true?"

He purposefully is leaving people out (I’d be angry too, if I was Ron.). I had an art teacher in High School or made very obvious that she had favorites. I didn’t resent the person who was a favorite, but I did not have warm fuzzy feelings for the teacher. I could be projecting, but the way he’s using Harry for social gain is pretty gross, as at this time he’s only 16 and has been through so much garbage in life he deserves to be treated like a student and not something that belongs on a pedestal.Slughorn is a kiss up: a short rant-thoughts?"

1,"Hi everyone! Before I dive into comparisons between the novels, let me give a quick introduction. Yesterday a post was made arguing that the Harry Potter novels have a 'symmetrical' structure. You can see what that means by looking at the original post here: [

This theory has been around for a while, but it always struck me as odd. Back in 2003-2007, the fan community noticed that Order of the Phoenix was a beat-by-beat remix of *Philosopher's Stone* (not Prisoner of Azkaban). The similarities are more than a few little references or callbacks; the two have an extremely similar overarching plot, and hit all the same narrative beats throughout the story. Upon the release of Half-Blood Prince, the community noticed it was full of similar beats to the Chamber of Secrets. These similarities were not quite as strong as those between Books 1 and 5, but are still fascinating and obviously deliberate on the part of JK.

The community noticed a pattern. If 5 is a callback to 1, and 6 is a callback to 2, then we all expected book 7 to be a callback to book 3. In other words, we thought books 5, 6 and 7 were going to repeat the beats of books 1, 2 and 3. Eventually Deathly hallows was released, and it turned out to be a callback to *nothing*. Overall it is a completely new plot and new structure, with its own narrative beats. It *does* contain many interesting references to POA: Harry losing his firebolt and getting a new mode of transport, a climax in the Shrieking Shack, etc etc. But this is confunded by the fact that book 7 essentially contains callbacks to all of the *other* books as well. In fact, there are quite a few GoF callbacks.

So this theory ended up being incorrect! Deathly Hallows was, overall, a totally new beast. However, this does not change that OOTP=PS and HBP=CS. That's where the 'Symmetry' theory comes in. Several years later, people started drawing up charts like the post I listed above. These charts argue that *Deathly Hallows* was the book that echoed Philosopher's Stone instead! This seemed crazy, because the entire narrative structure of Philosopher's Stone is already recycled in Order of the Phoenix. It goes far beyond just a few little references.

To that end, I'm going to show why the the Symmetry theory does not hit the mark. Following is a comparison between Philosopher's Stone and Order of the Phoenix, followed by a comparison between Chamber of Secrets and Half-blood Prince. The former comparison is completely missed by the Symmetry theory, although it thankfully recognized the latter comparison between books 2 and 6. And yet it only provides a small number of connections, and misses many of the most interesting callbacks! So I have included a much fuller list than that post did.

&amp;#x200B;

**Philosopher's Stone and Order of the Phoenix**

Main plot:

* Dumbledore is trying to guard a magical artifact from Voldemort.
* Harry and co want to know what is being guarded, but are repeatedly told to drop the issue.
* The artifact is in an underground area, and Harry must work through a series of rooms containing magical oddities to reach it
* As it turns out, Harry is one of the only people capable of taking the artifact
* Harry probably should have left it alone; the artifact was safe all along.
* Voldemort's henchman tries to force Harry to hand it over, and Harry refuses
* Voldemort himself steps in, and reads Harry's mind. He tries to seduce Harry to his side, then just tries to kill him.
* Dumbledore arrives just in time to confront Voldemort. The henchmen are defeated, but Voldemort flees.
* Harry and Dumbledore meet for a debriefing. Harry asks why Voldemort tried to kill him as a child.
* In PS, Dumblebore responds that he cannot answer. He says he will tell Harry when he is older. In OOTP, he finally answers.

Other noteworthy events:

* Hagrid is hiding a particularly dangerous creature from the authorities, and puts Harry, Ron and Hermione in charge of taking care of it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chamber of Secrets and Half-Blood Prince**

* A house elf visits number 4, Privet Drive.
* Harry meets the new DADA teacher before the school term starts. That teacher is keen to associate with the Boy Who Lived and benefit from doing so.
* Spider imagery repeatedly appears in HBP as a callback to CoS (e.g. Spinner's End, Aragog, Slughorn looking like a 'spider in the centre of a web')
* Harry spies on Malfoy at Borgin and Burkes. The Vanishing Cabinet, opal necklace and Hand of Glory all make an appearance.
* A powerful magic potion becomes key to the plot, and Harry uses it to retrieve critical information.
* Mysterious attacks occur around the school. Nobody dies from these attacks, but only through sheer luck.
* A character becomes attached to a used book, which is around 50 years old. That attachment ultimately leads them to crucial trouble.
* The young Tom Riddle makes his first appearance for the book in Chapter 13. The chapters are called 'The Very Secret Diary' (CoS) and 'The Secret Riddle' (HBP).
* There are hijinks involving Crabbe, Goyle and Polyjuice potion.
* In a scene involving Aragog, Harry learns the final, crucial piece of information. This information reveals the truth about something the young Tom Riddle did at school.
* The school's Vanishing Cabinet makes an appearance, being broken (CoS) and repaired (HBP).
* A climactic battle takes place in a secret, underground chamber associated with Salazar Slytherin (created by him, or created by Voldermort to house Slytherin's locket)
* Fawkes appears and sings during or after the climax.

As you can see, the symmetry post from yesterday catches some of the same connections between CoS and HBP, but it's so much more than that! Where Philosopher's Stone is concerned, however, the Symmetry theory just completely falls down. It notices some callbacks to PS in DH, and yet DH is full of callbacks to *all* of the other novels. The truly fascinating connection is between PS and OOTP, where we get almost the same major plotline.

I hope you have enjoyed reading!Harry Potter does not have a symmetrical or chiastic structure. But the reality is even more fascinating!"
1,"Duelling is all about reflexes and keeping a clear head in dangerous situations. Harry has been training for exactly the two things and also has spades of experience in the ""wild"". He is a natural Seeker and regularly finds and catches a tiny ball while flying at speeds &gt; 240 km/hr, all the while maneuvering around the opponent team. He has faced life-threatening alone and has accumulated the experience and street-smarts needed for an encounter.   


Harry's feats: 

**Sheer magical potency:**  
Fought off a 100 dementors as a 13 year old.

&gt;**At least a hundred dementors,** their hidden faces pointing up at him, were standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water were rising in his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again.... Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head... a woman...

**Reflexes:** [source](

I have already shown that Harry has quite impressive reflexes above with his flying skill and combat, certainly above a normal human. However, below I will dedicate a small section to combat reflexes. Again this RT was hard for me to do, so let me know if I'm not clear enough on some things.

* Faster than Lucius Malfoy. (OOTP)

&gt;\*""Harry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville spun himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest. Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled, “Impedimenta!”  
&gt;  
&gt;*Malfoy was blasted off his back. As Harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now dueling.*

* Faster than Bellatrix. (OOTP)

&gt;\*""The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked, “Accio Proph —”  
&gt;  
&gt;*Harry was just ready for her. He shouted “Protego!” before she had finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it.""*

* Reacts to a killing curse. (OOTP)

&gt;*""“Avada —”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry.""*

* Manages to block most of a non-verbal spell from Dolohov after its fired.

&gt;*""He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, “Protego!”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife but the force of it knocked him sideways, and he fell over Neville’s jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell.""*  


  
Word of god: [source]( says Harry beats her post Askaban

&gt;*Q: If Harry had a magic duel with Hermione, who would win ? (Doyle Srader, Nacogdoches, TX)*  
&gt;  
&gt;A: Very good question! Because until about halfway through Azkaban, Hermione would have won. But Harry - without anyone really noticing it - is becoming exceptionally good at Defence Against the Dark Arts. So that's the one area in which, almost instinctively, he is particularly talented. Apart from Quidditch.Harry is a better duelist than Hermione."

1,"What I mean is -Imagine if we had something like a full on epic fantasy set of tales set within the universe of HP, even say, just vignettes - some straight horror (like the Horcrux sequence in HBP), some pure fantasy - dealing with things that have nothing to do with Hogwarts, school in general, or Harry himself. Say a short story about the absolute terror of the Death Eaters from a victim's perspective, written in a Lovecraftian style that ends horribly. 

Or an adventure story set much earlier in the history of the world of HP, perhaps in the 17th century. 

Or a story about tying the world of HP into the Salem Witch Trials  


Or even say a story centered around maybe a group of people who go wandering into the woods and something like the films The Forest or Blair Witch project ensues, except within the frame of the HP universe: True terrors that would make you stay up at night.

I guess what I am saying is, I love HP but the glimpses at either the past (Tom Riddle's rise to power, youth) or things beyond that that we get are so tantalizing, that it almost feels like the ""Potter saga"" as it were limits a truly interesting fictional universe.Does anyone else find the ""lore""/world of HP more interesting than the series itself?"

1,"Same as title. Since the Hat did belong to Gryffindor originally, however, it's possible that he showed preferential treatment to students of his own house and didn't tell the other founders about this extra property at all. And even if students of the other houses would've been able to pull the artifacts of their respective founders, it's likely their status as horcruxes took away that property.If 'true' Gryffindors can pull Godric's Sword out of the Sorting Hat, what kind of objects can 'true' members of other houses pull from it?"

I guess because its magic most children would want to go but ,i see it SOOO hard to adjust.
Also, what happens when a child doesn't want to go to Hogwarts?? Like if the child already knows and is fond of something, like drawing, music or knows what to do with their life, or for some reason doesn't want to go to Hogwarts, what happens then?Muggleborns in 2021"

1. Who would you say cleaves most heavily to the book version - Harris or Gambon? Both in mannerisms and appearance?
2. Could you buy Harris' version of the character being able to portray the more powerful Dumbledore ""unleashes"" as it were in the later books, and the ""shadier"" or more subtle if you will aspects of the character? 
3. Has there ever been any stated reason as to why the producers etc felt the need for Gambon's version to be so radically different from Harris? One would think that with a change of actor for probably the second most important role, they would want to keep as close to the original actor as possible. But they change everything - mannerisms, demeanor, and even radically for some reason change his hair and beard (He looks terrible until HPB, lacking the regal sage-like appearance of Harris' version)Dumbledore: Harris, Gambon, and the books"

1,"So after the war, the Malfoys were there, uncertain of their future, but thanks to Lucius' contributing with the new Ministry testifying against his fellow Death Eaters and Narcissa's lying to Voldemort at the Forest, they were all pardoned and got away scot-free. Aside from their reputation, they'd all but lost their wands during the war: Lucius' was borrowed byy Voldemort and destroyed during the Battle of the Seven Potters, Draco's was taken by Harry at the Malfoy Manor, and Narcissa's was borrowed by Draco, who lost it at the Room of Requirements (if I remember correclty). 

Now that they were free, they'd have to get new ones, and the best place in Great-Britain is... Ollivander's, property of the wizard they assisted in the captivity and torture during the events of Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows. So, did the Malfoys just ignore the fact that their presence would probably frighten poor Mr. Ollivander (not to mentionattract everyone's hostility) and show up at his shop, or did they go somewhere else to buy new wands?Where did the Malfoys get new wands after the war?"

In that sense, I can see why many became Deatheaters; Even if one had no genuine hatred in their hearts for Muggles or the like, being a Deatheater gave them a ""family"" and an identity which transcended that of themselves alone. 

For HP and his friends, the bonds they forged through trouble and trial made them inseparable and forever linked in a way that most cannot ever hope to be.Does anyone else envy The Trio....Or even The Deatheaters?"
1,"Hi! Just having thoughts... Is there any evidence Snape's love for Lily was romantical? Because I'm pretty sure book has none. Was it another 'wizards peed on the ground until muggles invented toilets' thing Rowling said or tweeted? Don't ger me wrong, I'm pretty sure she meant it to be romantical, it just got me thinking... For me personally strong friendship with Lily would be better for Snape's 'hero character ark' Rowling planned, cause him doing things because of his best friend would be more relatable for characters and for us as fans than him being 'so fucking romantically obsessed with a 15 years dead woman', as most fans see him these days. I personally don't see him that way and I think it's mostly because I think I never really saw him being in love with Lily in the first place, while reading the Deathly Hallows.

1,"At time stamp 1:37 

In the forbidden forest after Harry has his scene in “limbo”. Voldemort comes-to and asks if he (Harry) is still alive. 
Narcissa Malfoy goes over to Harry’s body, bends down close and says “Is he alive? Draco, is he alive?”
I can’t seem to make sense as to why Narcissa asked Malfoy if Harry is alive? 
I’m confused because Malfoy is not present in this scene, nor has he been for quite a few scenes following up to this. I seem to be missing the link between Harry being “dead” and asking Malfoy for confirmation..?

1,"For an ""Unbreakable bank"" it sure doesn't live up to it's name. Let us rework it to make robbers shake at the mere name. I'll add my ideas, add any you might have.

1. Four armed statue like a Goro if he was a knight with five fingers. Armed with 2 poleaxes, a tower sheild, and an oversized hellboy hand that has hollowed out fingers which can shoot out projectiles via unrecoverable hole in palm of hands. Of course enchanted to hell and back.

2. Some sort of magic camera system that is disguised as bright lights with control room deep inside this ""bank"" (AKA fortress of doom) that can send out emergency signals.

3. Handprint ""scanner"" that once pressure is applied sends a magical needle (like the knive for confirming identity) that takes blood. Connected to a name card. Should you be a member of the bank the bank a card with name will be magiced into goblins hand.

4. Some sort of magical money card system. 'nough said.

5. Magical paintings of important goblin figures for a more robust security.

6. Remove the shaft. Deep hole that is filled with acid at the bottom. Vaults are flush against its smooth wall. Magic elevator system is used for traversal. Walls are filled with animate gargoyle statues. (Gargoyle statues outside on rooftop too.Gringotts is pathetic, let's overkill it!"

Currently listening to OOTP and I really think there could have been some great content added with the St. Mungo’s visit. I also don’t like how Kreacher’s more of an afterthought rather than a key aspect as to why everyone winds up at the MoM in the first place. Curious to see if the films get picked up in 50 years for a remake and what all the next group at the helm wants to include.

I think whoever/if ever there’s someone who takes up and recreates the HP films long down the road, they should treat it like Peter Jackson did with the LotR films. Same actors same director over the course of 7 movies. And sort of do what Richard Linklater did with Boyhood where he filmed the same actors over the course of 10 years or whatever.

1,"A line from chapter 33 of OoTP: “He knew that Ron was thinking exactly what he was: If he could have chosen any members of the D.A. in addition to himself, Ron, and Hermione to join him in the attempt to rescue Sirius, he would not have picked Ginny, Neville, or Luna.”  

Which D.A. members **would** Harry have chosen to attempt to “rescue Sirius” if given a choice between all of them? I’d hazard a guess at Fred and George for two of them, who seemed to excel at just about anything they actually cared about, the D.A. being one of those things (along with the fact that they were 7th years). Beyond that logic, D.A. progress is never really talked about for anyone other than Neville, who Harry (for some reason), as mentioned in this passage, would not have picked. We also know that Lee, Angelina, and Alicia are all 7th years, and Lee would naturally work well with Fred and George, so perhaps those three? Obviously Fred and George were gone by this point, but I’m talking about hypothetically if Harry could choose any three people among everyone in the D.A.  

Which three do you think he would’ve chosen, given that this passage states that he **would not** have picked Ginny, Neville, or Luna (even if any of them seem like the best choices)?Who would Harry have chosen to join him at the department of mysteries?"

Harry is busy packing away his school things in preparation for the new school year when something catches his eye. He leans down to pick it up and after examining the cover for a minute he seems to make a decision and starts walking towards the staircase cradling the book to his chest. 

Harry heads towards the drawing room where Petunia sits on the small sofa darning some socks for Vernon. She is so focused on her task that Harry is unsure that she heard him enter the room. He is, of course, used to being ignored so he begins speaking anyway. 

""Aunt Petunia?"" Harry wavered; standing in the doorway. Petunia didn't react to his greeting and continued her sewing.
""Aunt Petunia... I don't want to intrude or anything, but I thought that I'd like to show you something."" Harry continued unperturbed by the silence. 

Harry entered the room and sat down on the sofa next to Petunia who just barely let out a small huff to his sitting next to her. Harry looked at the book, and started, ""I know you don't like to talk about anything to do with my world...but, I just thought that maybe at some point you were involved when you were younger."" Harry stalled. 

He thought he could just barely see a change in the  speed of her pulling the thread through the fabric. She was definitely listening to him, so he continued, ""I mean... when my mom was young and she was in school. That maybe she had shown you some things and told you about certain aspects of being a witch."" Harry almost gasped out the last word. All such words that even remotely hinted at  the Wizarding world were treated like slurs in the Dursley household, but he powered through the awkward tension and said, ""I know you didn't like her being a witch, but of course you loved her. She was your sister after all. But, I wanted to share this with you."" Harry slowly placed the book into Petunia's lap and sat back quietly. 

Petunia put down the sock and glared at the picture book where Lily and James looked up at her from the cover. Petunia gasped slightly as the photo started waving at her and smiling. Petunia barely touched the cover, her hand wavering as if she wasn't allowed to touch it. 

Harry watched as she finally lifted the cover to reveal the first photos. She slowly started flipping page after page, revealing the photos of Lily and James smiling at school, Lily in her dress on their wedding day, Lily and James dancing together, and Lily pregnant with Harry. 

Petunia stopped flipping when she saw a photo of Lily relaxing in a small meadow surrounded by small white and yellow flowers. The photo flowed with the breeze as it lifted Lily's hair and made the grass wave. Petunia stroked the edge of the photo lightly and Harry was sure he heard her stifled a sob. 

Petunia continued looking through the photos of Harry's parents moving into their house, when Harry arrived, as well as some of Harry growing up for that first short year. Harry stayed very still and quiet during her inspection of the book.

Petunia didn't say a word as she softly closed the book and slipped it back unto his lap. Harry didn't think there was anything he could say in this moment, so he stood and started leaving the room when he heard her. 

""Thank you."" Petunia whispered as she wiped her eyes. Harry knew that was more than he could've asked for from his Aunt. He smiled softly and continued back to his room.My Own Head Cannon"

1,WarnerMedia Chief Jason Kilar Teases Mysterious 'Harry Potter' Sequels
1,"Don't laugh at me please, I'm completely serious. It always seemed to me that she was just pretending to adore Draco to get Harry's attention. He shouted rude things about him and his friends for the same reason.  It reveals a lot about who she hated the most: Hermione. It was probably because she was jealous of her, she thought she wanted to date Harry.  She also told Skeeter that Hermione had made him a love potion.  At the beginning of the sixth book, Draco noticed Harry's feet on the train. Pansy probably noticed, too, so she stroked Draco's hair and wanted him to grab her hand just to make Harry jealous.  To this, of course, it can be said that it makes no sense since she wanted to hand him over to the Dark Lord. We know Harry was dating Ginny at the end of the sixth year, which Pansy probably knew about, but certainly not about their (temporary) breakup. She must have felt terrible about it. She wanted to kill Harry so that (besides, of course, she didn't have to risk her life) if he wouldn't become hers, no other girl should get him. I'm very surprised that there are almost no fanfictions about this theory.Am I the only one, who thinks that Pansy had a crush on Harry the whole time?"

1,"Clemence Poesy is a very beautiful girl but for Fleur Delacour, who was supposed to be literal inhuman beauty, she was a bit underwhelming.Anyone else disappointed in the casting of Fleur in the movies?"
1,why did the snape never tell dumbledore where was voldemort's hideout?
1,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows nail art!
1,"**So these are the options:** Cedric Diggory, Sirius Black, Fred Weasley, Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks, Severus Snape, Dobby and Albus Dumbledore 

Now, I'm going to go through the list and give my opinion. 

**- Cedric Diggory** was not a character I got emotionally attached to, and to be very honest, though his death was sad, I didn't care to much. 

**- Sirius Black's** death was extremely sad for me. It took away Harry's chance to have a true family. However, Wizard Afterlife is a thing and I want James and Sirius to be together. 

**- Fred Weasley.** Extremely unnecessary death. His life was ahead of him. George's reaction broke me. Fred Weasley did not deserve to die. 

**- Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks** Once again, a very sad death. RIP Moony and Tonks. Remus dying made sure that all the Marauders were together which I like. I think it was important for this couple to die, because it shows that the war leaves orphans. However, teddy's experience was much better than Harry's. 

**- Severus Snape.** I dislike Snape. I don't really feel sad that he died. It was important to the plot for him to die. 

**- Dobby.** Another death that made me sob. It showed that even the smallest creatures can have the most heroic deaths. 

**- Albus Dumbledore** I cried a lot during his death, but kind of important to plot because it left everything on Harry's shoulders. 

So, if could save one person, it would be Fred because he was too young and I love him. 

Let me know your comments down below :)If you could save one person in Harry Potter, who would you save?"

1," Note: I will not be including the Cursed Child for this. That story is an absolute mess.

I always see people discussing Time Turners. People always say that because the Harry Potter universe is set on a fixed timeline, you can’t change the past. This is correct, but there are still ways that the system could be exploited.

Example A: Harry is about to be Kissed by a dementor. Harry from the future casts the Patronus Charm and saves his past self. His past self then uses a Time Turner. His past self becomes his future self, and saves his past self again. The cycle repeats.

This is a stable time loop. But how did it start? Future Harry has to save Past Harry so Past Harry can become Future Harry. The answer is simple: there is no beginning. This scenario appeared spontaneously. Theoretically, this means that a stable time loop can appear anywhere.

Example B:

Scenario 1: Harry is killed by Voldemort. This is a fixed timeline. Nothing happens.

Scenario 2: Harry is about to be killed by Voldemort. A stable time loop appears. Future Harry distracts Voldemort. Past Harry gets y and uses a Time Turner to become Future Harry. The cycle repeats.

Because stable time loops can appear anywhere, it is possible for everything to be solved with time travel. Past Harry is about to be killed by Voldemort? Future Harry saves him. Future Harry is about to be killed by Voldemort? Future Future Harry saves him.

Example C: Harry is standing in front of a locked door. Future Harry opens the door from the other side. Past Harry goes through the opened door and uses a Time Turner to become Future Harry. The cycle repeats.

Example D: Harry has unfinished homework. Future Harry gives Past Harry finished homework. Past Harry makes a second copy. Past Harry uses a Time Turner to become Future Harry. The cycle repeats.

It is important to note that nothing will guarantee that a stable time loop will appear. However, there is always a chance of one occurring. That means, in an alternate timeline, Harry could have all of his problems solved by time travel.

If you have anything that can explain why this theory would or would not work, or if you need clarification on anything, feel free to post something in the comment section. Thanks!An Analysis of Time Turners"
1,Even this valentine has Expelliarmus as Harry's only spell
1,"He's informed he's out of horcruxes, he's surrounded, and he has no reason to believe that the Elder Wand's loyalty is absolitely with him.
There's probably doubt in his mind that he could hope to make even one more horcrux as well, and he doesn't seem creative enough to make another Philosopher's Stone.Was Voldemort's last duel with Harry intentional suicide?"

1,If ghosts can remember everything couldn’t dobby have come back and still worked in the kitchens as ghosts can move objects an example of that is Peeves also obviously most people don’t want to have to stay forever although you would think atleast one of Harry’s ancestors would be a ghost and not abandon him although that would not make a good story.Can house elves be ghosts
1,That’s exactly what had happened - 100%
1,"Can someone please tell me why the mystery wands are $13.88 but here in Canada they are $44??? Why is the markup $30? And where, if any place, in Canada can I get them cheaper then $44?"

1,"Warning: Potential spoiler for WandaVision episode 8.

I was re-listening to Deathly Hallows and am at the part where Harry is mourning Dobby's death.
He realises that he has finally learned to shut his mind to Voldemort. That GRIEF it seemed, drove Voldemort out. He is sure that Dumbledore would be certain it was LOVE.

In WandaVision episode 8 Vision says this to Wanda when the latter is mourning her brother's death: ""What is grief, if not love persevering?""

I felt this to be a beautiful parallel between the two.[Spoiler] A nice parallel between HP and WandaVision"

1,"Nothing is sadder than poor Neville feeling like he can’t be honest with his friends about what happened with his parents.

1,"So hi... I decided to write this Sorting Hat song, I don't know if it's right to say that Gryffindor seek fairness (idk?) but please don't hate and I know that the ending is a bit bad hahaha

&amp;#x200B;

*So here am I back this year*

*To sort all the first year again*

*For centuries and ages back*

*As far as I can remember*

*I’m brought on a stool each year*

*On the first day of September*

*To get an answer they long have waited on*

*Where do I belong?*

&amp;#x200B;

*Gryffindor is searching for those who seek justice*

*Hufflepuff is questing for those who seek fairness*

*Ravenclaw is looking for those who seek knowledge*

*While Slytherins wants the ones who seek success*

&amp;#x200B;

*Red or yellow, green or blue*

*What colour will you have on your uniform?*

*There’s nothing in your head*

*That I will not find out*

*It doesn’t matter who you are*

*I will always find the best house for you*

&amp;#x200B;

*Maybe you belong in Gryffindor*

*Where you will find those who stand up for the weaker*

*Maybe you should br in Hufflepuff*

*Where you will find those who are hardworking and loyal*

*Maybe Ravenclaw is best for you*

*Where you will find those with a strong thirst for knowledge*

*Or maybe you should be in Slytherin*

*Where you will find those with ambition and great leaders*

&amp;#x200B;

*Maybe you’ll be lucky to be with your sisters and brothers*

*Or maybe you’ll break the long family tradition*

*So let the Sorting start*

*Put me on your head*

*And I will find your place*

1,"As much as I love Sirius, I have to say that his bullying is obviously what made the difference in snapes later life. If he hadn’t been so horrendously bullied into becoming entrenched in his beliefs he might’ve actually seen the error in death eater logic. Of course Sirius did it because he was taking out his own insecurities, but that doesn’t excuse his choice.!Snapes spiral into villainy"
1,"If it wasn't for his scheming with Quirrell and releasing the troll in the school, Harry and Ron wouldn't have befriended Hermione (and probably would have died of hunger during book 7 if not something else).I just realized that Voldemort didn't only set up his own failure and death, but he's also responsible for Harry having one of his best friends."
1,Just started reading my first Harry Potter book. Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone. It's very interesting and I'm already at Chapter 5. I googled a picture of Dumbledore's watch. It looked so cool I had to save it. Do they sell watches like this you can wear on your hand anywhere?
1,"The most unbelievable thing about the HP universe is that Harry doesn't have Borderline Personality Disorder for years of childhood neglect, abuse and generally being treated like a dog"
1,"""Honestly, am I the only person who’s ever bothered to read Hogwarts: A History?"""
1,"Picture this, the fourteen rise up into the sky but no death eaters are waiting for them. Now we can't pass up such a clear opportunity for a battle scene, so naturally, we pit them against each other. Who do you have winning?

Fight takes place in the sky above Little Whinging. Must kill, disable, or ground opponents to win.

Team 1: Mad-eye and Mundungas on brooms: The most reliable auror in the series, but will a git of a partner hold him back?

Team 2: Tonks and Ron on brooms: The only pair to include both and auror and Quidditch player. Could be interesting.

Team 3: Arthur and Fred on brooms: The father son tag-team, what more to want?

Team 4: Remus and George on brooms: A very capable member of the order of the phoenix with probably one of the most agile fliers in the fight. (No ear injury limitations)

Team 5: Bill and Fleur on a thestral: Head boy and triwizard champion, a force to be reckoned with, but not a lot of dueling experience and could have some mobility issues.

Team 6: Kingsley and Hermione on a thestral, what's better than one future minister of magic, how about two?

Team 7: Hagrid and Harry on the bike: Not a lot of magic, but it takes a lot to take Hagrid out, and how will the motorcycle modifications come into play . Will Harry throw anything besides Expelliarmus though?

Let me know who you think would be the last team remaining. Curious to hear everyone's thoughts

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  My first thought (which I realize I never posted) was actually Bill and Fleur given that they have as much magical prowess as a team as anyone and theoretically fight together as well as anyone. Both have experience in dangerous situations, especially given that Bill is a bit of an adrenaline junky. Not sure how fighting on a thestral would go, but I still like their chances. I appreciate how many different cases are being made for everyone, including me, there have been arguments made for five of the seven teams.So the seven Potters fight each other, who wins?"
1,"What I would like to see is an alternate timeline where Harry shook Draco's hand when they met, and was therefore excited to be placed in Slytherin. 
I mean J.K obviously hasn't stopped with the pottermore (special editions) alterations to the books; surely she could just write 7 alternate timeline books.What I would like to see"
1,"With Hogwarts Legacy on the way, I think it's high time the American Wizarding school show itself in a  new game series, one for each year. But how should it be done? Well,  here's what I would do personally.

Like with Hogwarts Legacy, you play as a customized character. Like with Commander Shepard in Mass Effect, your first name is never mentioned, instead, everyone calls you by your last name, Princeton. (I picked a random last name.) You are a half blood, a Witch mother, and a No-Maj father. Unlike Harry, you aren't a chosen one, instead you fall into the role of hero for a different reason I'll reveal later.

Upon arriving at Ivermorny, ALL the statues show an interest in you, allowing you to chose your house. This will grant you bonuses in certain fields, and dictates how other characters will interact with you. But you soon realize that like at Hogwarts, something is very VERY wrong. Ilvermorny, at the time of your education is a school with it's own fair share of problems. A common description of Ilvermorny is that in Hogwarts, trouble starts outside and works it's way in. But in Ilvermorny, trouble starts in the headmasters office and works it's way down. It's a hellhole of a school full of sadist teachers, even harsher rules and punishments when they are not being used for double standards, a headmaster who acts more like a corporate CEO or mob boss then a headmaster, bullies, and the prefects act more like secret police. The subjects are taught in ways similar to how Umbridge taught DATDA, very little magic is actually used, instead, it's mostly book reading.

Ilvermorny soon seems more like luxurious prison than an actual school, and you soon learn that there are students who have been taking self taught magic lessons in a hidden part of Ilvermorny similar to the Room of Requirement. Each individual plot is similar to the individual plots of books and movies, searching for a macguffin, learning about Ilvermorny's history, major school events, plots and conspiracy's, etc.

And your choices will impact how the story plays out. You have a supporting cast made up of students from all the other houses, and your choices will dictate your relationships with them. You can make enemies of varying levels, rivals, friends, and even have romances in later games. And like in Mass Effect, your choices will carry into the next game, and your relationships with characters can change over the course of the series. A friend in one game, may betray you in another game if you made certain choices, conversely, an enemy you made in one game, may become a friend in a later game, again, depending  on your choices. And your choices will also impact the plots of future games as well. Your companions may also get into disputes which you can try to resolve either by picking one side over the other, or making a compromise.

And of course, you can choose if you want to be heroic, villainous, or somewhere in the middle.

In each game, more and more is revealed. You learn that America was influenced by Voldemort during the first Wizarding War and he had spies working for him in America. America fears that if one wizard could go that bad, why not another? So the magical congress as been influencing Ilvermorny to have ALL the classes  In addition, the changes and reforms at Ilvermorny began at your first year. It seems one puzzle leads to another. To make matters even stranger, in the 3rd or 4th game, you learn that you can speak parstletongue.

At the end of the 5th game, you finally learn that the reason the congress is doing this, and why they are seemingly after you. You are a direct descendant of Isolt Sayre through her daughter, Martha Sayre's family line. And since you are a direct descendant of Isolt Sayre, you are a descendant of Salazar Slytherin. And the Magical Congress is after you because they fear you will become the American Voldemort.

In hindsight, the conflict is more complicated than just good vs evil. It's more conflict between individuals who fear what you might become, and your supporters. Funny enough, like in Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, you can actually become the villain the Congress fears you will become if you want to. And by the end of the final game, you set in motion the chain of events that will lead to you to ""finish Voldemort's noble goal."" But you can also show the world that your ancestry does not dictate who you are, and become whatever kind of hero you desire. Perhaps you will try to show the Congress that you are not Salazar Slytherin, and redeem your ancestry, and even try to redeem your enemies. Or perhaps you will take a more aggressive route and actively try to overthrow the Congress and rebuild it as a just government.

And there's different ways to be a hero or a villain. Are you like Harry, brave and humble? Or are you someone more ambitious and proud? Do you seek wealth and power or not? Do you join the Quipod teams? What is your story?If you were designing a game set in Ilvermorny, what would you do?"
1,"How does the splitting of the soul for making horcruxes work? 
I mean does the soul splits in half every time? Because that would mean the dairy contains 1/2 of Voldemorts soul. So Harry would have killed the biggest pice of Voldemort already in his second year.  But if we think this further it also means that in the original body (I mean the one that's made in GoF) only contains 1/128 of the soul. Do you think this has some effect on his humanness or something else? (Clearly the power level doesn't change, otherwise voldi wouldn't have made horcruxes, there you might not disagree with me) 
Or does this whole thing work this way at all?

1,"I'm rereading COS and I just got to the bit where Peeves destroys the vanishing cabinet. We know later on that Dumbledore was surprised to learn that it was a part of a pair, but considering all of the secrets students learned that Dumbledore did not know, do you think anyone else ever figured out that method in and out of Hogwarts? All Draco did was ""mend it"" which tells me that prior to it breaking it served it's function and was connected to the other one, and it was apparently accessible enough to students for Montague to be shoved into itVanishing Cabinet"

In Order of the Phoenix, after the dementor attack on Harry and Dudley, Vernon and Petunia want to throw Harry out on the streets as they believed he attacked/ cursed Dudley. During the argument Petunia recieved a howler from a booming voice with the words ""Petunia, remember my last."" 

Harry later recognises the voice belongs to Dumbledore. Does anyone know if this is the letter he placed with Harry on the day he was left on their doorstep, or has he written to Petunia after that? I wonder what the last letter said.""PETUNIA, REMEMBER MY LAST..."" What did this mean?"

1,"What school would students go to if they immigrated? Like let's say I went to Ilvermorny for my first two years then because of work or some other reasons my parents had move to England permanently. Would I have to travel back to the States every school year? Would I go to Hogwarts as I now live in England? Would I get a choice perhaps? 

So I tried looking for this topic but the closest I could find was debates on exchange students. Which while interesting isn't quite what I'm looking for today. My hope would be to choose because I can see benefits to both options. I also wonder if your citizenship would matter, like becoming a British citizen vs living there on a long term visa. I'm just curious what other people think.Immigration and school placement"

1,I don’t know why but I imagine myself as the duelling fighting type but in reality if you’re a wimp in real life you’d probably be scared to fight in the wizarding world too right ?Does anyone else think they’d be the type to be learning defence against the dark arts and duel all the time even though they’re wimps when it comes to real life fighting ?

I’ve always had all 7/8 of both the books/movies but never touched them, until I decided that I should finally get into the Potterverse and instantly fell in love.

1. What is your favorite book and how well did you like it’s move adaptation?

2. What is your favorite movie and how well do you like it’s corresponding book? (also what rank is it in of all the books)

1,"My niece has seen the movies but tried reading Harry Potter for the first time on her own at the start of quarantine but stopped because it was too challenging. She’s improved so much so I wrote her a note to see if she would like to try again with me this time. (Her parents aren’t super into HP like I am, so not stepping on toes!) She agreed and now we have a standing date every Wednesday to read a chapter together!!

I am so excited to go on this journey with her and see the story through her eyes. If you all have ideas for how I can make the experience even better, please let me know! Her birthday is later this month and want to make her something related...maybe her own letter to Hogwarts that she could use as a bookmark? But I want to send her little gifts as the time goes on as this will be a great way for us to bond together. 

Eeeee I’m just so excited!!! I’ve been waiting for this moment since she was born!Starting the books with my 9 year old niece tonight! So excited!"
1,"Hi Potter Heads!

A few years back an exboyfriend go this RavenClaw a Gryffindor Jersey customized with her first initial and last name on it. Now many years later, I only wore it once and would love for a Gryffindor to have it. 

The problem: my first initial and last name are part of the fabric, it appears to have all been printed as one piece, as in the letters can't be peeled off. 

So it's a size small and has the number 01 on it and is 100% polyester. The name is B. Magee. If you happen to know any Magee out there who might want this, please pass it on. I would love to send it to them. It is the shirt below, but of course it has the name previously mentioned.

1,"I feel like they must, because of the flesh memory with Harry's first snitch, and with James stealing the snitch when he was at school. But it seems like a bit if a waste of money if they buy one snitch for each match, then get rid of it after it's over or just store them all in a big cabinet. But they'd be buying like 7 snitches per year. That would add up.

They could just buy one a year and that's why the snitch Harry caught had the flesh memory still active, cause his match was first. But then no one else would be able to use it for that purpose. And if they don't need to use that function in matches, then why buy a new snitch before each year and not just use the one they have in storage?

And I don't think the flesh memory could be reset, because then why would the manufacturer's have to wear gloves when making them? They could just reset the flesh memory if they could.Does Hogwarts buy a new snitch for each match?"

1,"I personally don't think Draco Malfoy was really ""broken"" in any way. Sure, his father could have raised him better but he was not starved and scolded for everything he did like Harry. And he always got treated with luxury goods from his father like his nimbus 2001. And In the books he didn't have much depth and was nothing more than a bully that made fun of people for their, looks, blood type, and how wealthy their family was. I do think that in the movies he had more depth and seemed to be more than just the bully he appeared to be, BUT I hate how people are comparing him to Harry! Harry's parents died, a nose-less murderer is trying kill him, Draco bullies him, people only like him cause hes the chosen one, his aunt and uncle starve and neglect him, and so much more. And to be honest who even COMPARES TRAUMAS? Anyways thanks for listening to me rant aha. Just joined the group!Draco Malfoy was NOT Broken"

I am re-rereading the HP books again and noticed in book 1 chapter nine that it talks about Charlie being a good seeker and that they had a major loss the year prior AND the twins said they hadn’t won the cup since Charlie left. The issue that i am seeing is (if I’m correct) Charlie only graduated the last year. Charlie left hogwarts in July of 91. (Born in 72. Hogwarts 84-91) And Harry started in sept of 91.Is this right??"

1,A purse based on Tom Riddle's Diary! (Made by me)
1,Can anyone tell my what happen
1,"Pluck a piece of the crumbling archway itself and shape it into the resurrection stone. 

Cut a piece of the ""veil"" off for the invisibility cloak.

The wand is a little harder to place but the book gives us ""the archway was HUNG with a tattered black CURTAIN or veil which"". To hang a curtain you need something to mount it on, usually a curtain pole. Sure it could just be draped over without a mount but I think that would have been specified in the writing, whereas hung is specified. The mount could have been metal or stone or magical but wooden curtain poles are very common. The wand could just be made out of that.

Also the term veil is clearly used as it already has connotations with death. The term ""behind the veil"" is used to mean ""In an inexplicable or concealed place or condition, especially the mysterious state of existence after death"". So I think that the perceived imagery of a thin semi see through wedding veil hanging over the archway is wrong. Harry couldn't see through it, so it is in fact a curtain in it's physical sense, and it's veil-ness in a more metaphorical imagery inducing sense, so it needs a nice strong physical elder wood pole to hold it.

About the thestral hair inside, i think that all of the artefacts needed enchanting further before they became the hallows, I think the archway just provided a nice basis to begin. So the thestral hair was just put inside once they got the wood home, like the stone was shaped later, and the cloak was modified later.

Lastly ""the Veil has been in the Ministry as long as the Ministry itself has been there."" the ministry was founded in 1707 but the wizards council came before that, I am assuming the premises are the same. The earliest known wizard council member is Barberus Bragge, who was the Chief in 1269. The hallows were made in the 1200s. Maybe the peverell brothers discovery of the archway and their subsequent creation of the hallows was the necessity that warranted the creation of the wizards council, just like the statute of secrecy warranted the creation of the ministry.Are the hallows made from the archway?"
1,"Ok so this might be a bold opinion but I've just finished re-reading the third and fourth books and I just felt like punching Ron most of the time.

I know many people love him and he does have some redeeming traits but he is just so annoying. 
He keeps complaining about everything, first his rat then his new owl, which he got for free, his clothes which his mom works hard to make, etc.

He is very rude to pretty much everyone (and then gets surprised he can't find a date for the Yule ball) and especially Hermione when she didn't do anything wrong just because he's jealous and controlling of her. He ignores her for like a year in book 3 because he thinks it's her fault Scabbers disapeared and even when he finds out it wasn't he still never apologizes!

He is so jealous of Harry, his best friend, in book 4 that he refuses to believe his word and turns things even worse for Harry. 

I do feel like he has his moments and I feel kinda bad for him (his ""I hate being poor"" moment and others) but that doesn't excuse his nasty behavior. Most of the time he acts like an entitled, mean brat that doesn't deserve his friends for how poorly he treats them.Ron was a major jerk in books 3 and 4..."

1,"Some Theories I have

My first theory is about credence. SPOILERS FOR FANTASTIC BEAST 2 AND HP 7: In the end of FB2 Grindelwald tells credence he is a Dumbledore. I think it’s quite unlikely that there is two obscuro in the dumbledore family being credence and Ariana. My theory is that Ariana and credence is the same person. Maybe she didn’t die and just transformed Into someone else or attached herself to someone else. Or maybe Grindelwald just told Credence to make him angry with dumbledore.

My second theory’s not that big but here it comes: Grindelwald was defeated in 1945 the same year WW2 ended. Maybe Grindelwald cursed Hitler or maybe it’s just coincidental.

What do you think of these theories?My Theories :)"

1,"This post analyzes the inner struggles Harry experiences in rooting his identity in his father and identifying with the Half-Blood Prince, focusing on books 5-7. Harry's idolization and disillusionment of Prongs parallels his idolization and disillusionment of the Prince a year later. 

&amp;#x200B;

For ""nearly five years,"" Harry idolizes his father and enjoys being compared with him. Harry witnessing SWM is a major upheaval for him in what he believes about James and, therefore, what he believes about himself through his own identification with James: 

&gt;""**Harry’s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been a prefect either**. All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; he loaded up his plate, feeling unusually fond of everyone in the room.""  
&gt;  
&gt;“Of course I do!” said Sirius. “D’you think your father and I would’ve lain down and taken orders from an old hag like Umbridge?”  
&gt;  
&gt;""Harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteen-year- old father...**Excitement exploded** in the pit of his stomach: **It was as though he was looking at himself**...""  
&gt;  
&gt;""For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort, of inspiration. Whenever someone had told him he was like James he had glowed with pride inside. And now ... **now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him**.""

&amp;#x200B;

Harry's first reaction to this great personal conflict is to reject it:

&gt;He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was **desperate to hear** Sirius’s own account of what had happened, to know of any mitigating factors there might have been, **any excuse at all** for his father’s behavior. . .

Harry is willing to confront the conflict by investigating, but he's desperately hoping to find evidence that supports his original, positive views of James. We see his attitude change before he actually gets to contact Sirius:

&gt;""**He could abandon the plan** and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summer’s day more than twenty years ago...  
&gt;  
&gt;And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor common room... ’’You ’re less like your father than I thought... The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James...”   
&gt;  
&gt;**But did he want to be like his father anymore**? “Harry, don’t do it, please don’t do it!” Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class.

Harry now confronts 2 separate personal conflicts: was his dad a good person *and* does Harry want to be like him anymore. He takes great efforts in order to communicate with Sirius over this; when he doesn't receive the sort of counter-evidence he originally hoped for, he's willing to champion the moral view by rejecting Sirius and Lupin's excuses for James, thereby condemning his father's actions as wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite condemning his father's actions, Harry isn't ready to reject James. Harry reacts fondly when Ron ""sweeping his hair"" while recounting a Quidditch match reminds him of his dad's efforts to look cool. Then in HBP, Harry is thrilled by the possibility that his Potions book annotations might be authored by his dad:

&gt;“**My dad used this spell**,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.” This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular excursion into the Pensieve. **Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be —?**

Although several months prior, James' use of Levicorpus on Snape disgusted Harry (who identified with Snape in that moment: ""he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew exactly how Snape had felt""), Harry is willing to overlook his previous objections and repulsion in the face of new evidence of his dad being cool in the mysterious character of ""the Half-Blood Prince."" It is a testament to how deeply Harry connects with ""the Prince"" that Harry is willing to put James back up on a pedestal should James and the Prince prove to be one and the same. Through the textbook, Harry is able to see how Levicorpus can be a funny spell when used between friends when he accidentally casts it on Ron. (It's also his first use of nonverbal magic, a skill which he had struggled with earlier in his 6th year lessons.) He and Ron defend the Prince from Hermione's reproach when she compares Levicorpus to the similar spell used to torment the Muggle family at the World Cup campgrounds in GoF.  

Harry determines to ask Lupin about the Half-Blood Prince (believing him to be his dad) in a way the echoes Harry contacting Sirius to discover more about what sort of person his dad was. However, this time, Harry feels ""excitement"" akin to what he felt at the start of SWM when first seeing his dad, before his idealized perception of his dad was broken:

&gt;Harry, meanwhile, felt **a rush of excitement**: This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been **looking forward to asking** Lupin.   
&gt;  
&gt;“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half- Blood Prince?”

Lupin connects ""the prince"" to Harry, believing it to be a title Harry is considering for himself:

&gt;“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “**Is this a title you’re thinking of adopting**? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’ would be enough.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“**It’s nothing to do with me!**” said Harry indignantly. 

Although Harry protests that the HBP has nothing to do with him, he obviously wants the title to have something to do with him because he hopes it belongs to his dad. This desired connection is understandable considering Harry saw the Prince as a ""**guide and friend.""** In the character of the Prince, Harry can idealize his father again. We see how much the connection matters to him: 

&gt;**He tried to sound casual**, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupin’s smile was a little too understanding.

When Lupin convinces Harry that James was not the Prince, Harry defaults to his next best options, trying to graft his strong connection to the Prince onto Sirius or Lupin:

&gt;Abandoning pretense, Harry said, “And **it wasn’t Sirius**? Or **you**?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Definitely not.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“Oh.” Harry stared into the fire. “I just thought — well, he’s helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.”

Harry doesn't elaborate what he ""just thought,"" but we can assume Harry holds the Prince in great esteem since he hoped the Prince would turn out to be one of the 3 people he expressed admiration for in the past. We can imagine that the Prince's help was something Harry greatly valued since Harry stubbornly persists in this imagined connection, defending the Prince multiple times, even after almost killing Draco with Sectumsempra: 

&gt;**you can’t blame the Prince**, he hadn’t written ‘try this out, it’s really good’ — he was just making notes for himself, wasn’t he, not for anyone else…”

Sectumsempra itself wasn't a dealbreaker for Harry. Only the fear of getting caught out by Snape persuades him to get rid of the textbook temporarily. Harry had intended to retrieve it from its hiding place. He is desperate to keep this connection with the Prince and to preserve an untarnished view of him. 

&amp;#x200B;

In identifying with the Prince and defending him, Harry explores ideas about himself:

&gt;“I don’t believe this,” said Hermione. “You’re actually defending — ”   
&gt;  
&gt;“**I’m not defending what I did**!” said Harry quickly. “I wish I hadn’t done it, and not just because I’ve got about a dozen detentions. **You know I wouldn’t’ve used a spell like that**, not even on Malfoy, but **you can’t blame the Prince**...""

In the same breath, Harry states he isn't defending his own actions against Draco, but he defends the Prince for supplying the spell. It's practically a defense of his own actions by proxy. 

Harry claims he ""wouldn't've used a spell like that"" when he absolutely did use a spell ""like that"" (meaning thoughtlessly). Harry most likely meant he wouldn't have used Sectumsempra in particular if he knew what its effects were, but Harry has spent months testing the Prince's spells on other people without proof that he knew their effects beforehand:

&gt;""Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince’s self- invented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing,""

Although Harry wishes he ""hadn't done it"" not ""just because"" of his detentions, he is generally cavalier about almost murdering Draco. He doesn't disagree with Ginny when she characterizes Sectumsempra as ""**something** **good** **up** **his** **sleeve**!” It is not until Snape reveals himself as the Half-Blood Prince, after doing the unthinkable--murdering Dumbledore--that Harry has a change of heart regarding the book and its author. (Just like Harry didn't reject James completely after SWM, Harry doesn't reject the Prince completely after this betrayal: while Harry believes Snape to be a true DE, he still makes use of the spells he learned from the textbook, although not Sectumsempra.)

&amp;#x200B;

The Prince offers a hero's aid to Harry, who credits him for feats of heroism (saving Ron's life) and great skill (winning Felix):

&gt;""without the Prince I’d never have won the Felix Felicis. I’d never have known how to save Ron from poisoning, I’d never have — ”  
&gt;  
&gt;“ — got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don’t deserve,” said Hermione nastily

By pointing out that Harry earned his Potions reputation undeservedly through the Prince, who was the true brilliant Potioneer, Hermione points out that Harry and the Prince are one and the same--at least as far as Slughorn is concerned. Harry echoes this close relationship by attributing his recent accomplishments to the Prince. He is able to put the Prince's directions into action (in a sense, embodying the Prince). 

Seeing the Prince as a person who helps him accomplish amazing things is not unlike the way Harry viewed his own father in PoA when Harry casts his Patronus to save Sirius from dementors. 

&gt;“Come on!” he muttered, staring about. “Where are you? Dad, come on — ”   
&gt;  
&gt;But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It was time for the rescuer to appear — but no one was coming to help this time — **And then it hit him — he understood. He hadn’t seen his father — he had seen himself — Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand**.

Harry's deep betrayal by the Prince (which occurs when Harry connects the Prince with Dumbledore's killer) is similar to his reaction to seeing his father's ugly and dark side:

&gt;He could not stop himself dwelling upon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape…but as Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him, **he, Harry, had been taken in just the same**…in spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, **he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so much...**  
&gt;  
&gt;Helped him ... **it was an almost unendurable thought now**

Harry feels ""cold and miserable at the thought of \[his father\]**""** after witnessing his behavior in SWM and he finds thoughts of Prince's previous help ""unendurable"" to bear after witnessing Snape murder Dumbledore. 

Harry undergoes the same pattern of idolization and disillusionment with both characters. JKR made this parallel explicit by having Harry mistake ""the Prince"" for his dad: who on earth would mix up James Potter and Severus Snape? Yet that is exactly what Harry had done for months. 

&amp;#x200B;

In DH, Harry is able to truly find himself in both men. Harry admonishes Lupin for leaving his family by wielding James' memory against him, saying, ""I’m pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you aren’t sticking with your own kid, actually."" Harry claims James would want to know why Lupin has left Teddy, but it is Harry himself who demands this explanation from Lupin and counters Lupin's logic that Teddy is safer with him gone. When Harry battles Voldemort, he taunts him with Snape's true allegiance, announcing ""**Snape was Dumbledore’s**,"" once again feeling confident to speak for a dead man. Harry effectively gives Snape the title he himself was proudest to bear:

&gt;“**Dumbledore’s man** through and through, aren’t you, Potter?”   
&gt;  
&gt;“Yeah, I am,” said Harry. “Glad we straightened that out.”

It is not so surprising that Harry names his sons **James** Sirius and Albus **Severus**, or that he is able to forgive both men for their failings considering that viewing Snape's memories is what sets Harry off on the journey to his own death and Harry summons James (and Lily, Lupin, and Sirius) to help him complete that journey. It makes sense then, that when Harry does manage to escape death, he memorializes them in his future and his legacy by passing their names to his children.

1,"I'm talking about [this scene]( in the books. I was reading it again last night and for some reason the magnitude of this moment really stuck with me this time. 

As opposed to the memory he has of it as a toddler, this time Harry can actually take in the immense tragedy that was his parents' death. Seeing the green light and literally hearing death flying toward you. In a split-second it erases your life, your soul and your memories. You're dead, just like that.

It's completely terrifying to think about. You can't stop it, you can't save yourself. If someone performs this on you, the green light will be the last thing you see and the soaring of death will be the last thing you hear, Harry and the extraordinary circumstances that led to his survival being the singular exception.

I can't imagine what Harry must have felt during this moment when death itself was in that classroom with them in form of green light and rushing sound. Forced to consciously relieve the moment his mother died in front of him in exactly the same way. Devastating.

1,"I want to discuss how Harry Potter and the Wizarding World has played a part in our lives. Harry Potter is currently the 3rd and 4th top selling book series of all time next to the DaVinci Code and the Bible and has been translated into over 80 languages. It dominated the pop culture during the 2000s and played a heavy part in many peoples adolescence. I to have a discussion and have a look at all the different ways the series has impacted people in different ways. Sort of show the reach the series has had. 

I can still remember my Aunt bringing home DVD copies of the first 4 films from a blockbuster video. We watched them all over a week. I was very young at the time and I remember being incredibly scared of the snakes and spiders in the second film. I remember seeing films 5-8 in theatres. I can remember questioning my sexuality when Robert Grint got abs. I can remember adoring various LEGO Harry Potter building sets along with enjoying the LEGO Harry Potter video game.

Harry Potter was one of the few franchises that my whole family could enjoy togethor. Most franchises were somewhat exclusive to certain family members growing up. Disney and Pixar was for me, my sister and my mother. Bourne was something that me and dad enjoyed. But Harry Potter was something everyone got into. We bought all the movies on DVD, and during Snowmageddon we had a marathon with all of them. It's still today a franchise that we all hold a soft spot for. One of the few times me and my sister ever connected on something was when she read the books to me and my mother. And Fantastic Beasts was one of the last times my whole family all went to a theatre togethor.

In short, Harry Potter played a huge part of my growing up, and I hold a lot of nostalgia for all the characters, ideas, and imagination. But I also know that this world has been a much larger part of other people's lives. I know some people stood in lines for hours to pick up the next issue. I knew a girl in high school who cried when Allen Rickman passed, because his portrayal of Severous was that important to her.  
My experience is mostly connected to the films, but I know the Books did to Bibliophiles what Star Wars did to Cinephiles.

So please, if you can, take a moment and write about how Harry Potter, wether it be the books, films, toys, or audio books, talk about how it affected you. Did it teach any moral lessons, connect you with any people, help you through any depressions, did HP motivate you to create anything? Let's have a discussion.How did Harry Potter personally affect you?"

1,"I’m rewatching the movies after I reread the books, again. (Full disclosure, I didn’t actually read them I listened to them. Audiobooks are magical.) In the last movie, during the Battle of Hogwarts, there’s a scene where Neville, so pumped up he feels like he can spit fire, asks Harry and Ginny if they know where Luna is. He wants to tell her he’s mad for her, since they’ll probably both be dead by dawn. Neville runs off to find her, and before separating Harry and Ginny kiss and then Harry looks Ginny in the eyes and nonverbally says, “I love you.” Ginny replies with a simple, “I know.” It could be just a coincidence, but Ginny is on the left, same as Leia in the Star Wars scene. Also, in both scenes the characters know it could possibly be the last time they see each other, especially right after Neville says that they’ll probably be dead by dawn. That was the first time Leia says it to Han, and this would be the first time Harry says it to Ginny.

1,"found this gem on wattpad. tw: swearing and drug use

[ a funny fanfic (tw: swearing and drug use)"
1,"A comment on Harry Potter Theory's video on Voldemort vs Grindlewald cleared the Wackspurts from my brain and got me thinking. For context, this was the comment that got me thinking on that:

""

Voldy when he wants to kill you: The boy who lived came to die, AVADAARFDHFJRINNSS!

&amp;#x200B;

Grindy : Hello, Harry. How wonderful of you to finally join me. Please, sit down. Would you like a cup of tea before we get down to business? About that, really, you have to let me explain and understand that........

""

Yes, it was a funny comment, but it still got me thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

Say Grindlewald escapes Numenguard. Later, he hears about Harry and Voldemort. He discovers Harry is called the Boy Who Lived and why. Then, he discovers that Voldemort wants to kill Harry and why. However, Grindlewald has other ideas. Still determined to bring about his vision of a greater good, Grindlewald sets out to gather new followers, take back control of Numenguard, (Or find a new place?) and then capture Harry Potter and bring him to his side. Incidentally saving him from Voldemort if he succeeds.

&amp;#x200B;

How would he go about it? How would he gather new followers? How would he wage war against Voldemort and his army?  How would he confront the Aurors and Hit Wizards?  How would he put his ole' chum Dumbledore out to pasture? How would he sway Harry? How sick would a three-sided mosh pit of a wizard battle look on the big screen?

&amp;#x200B;

Next thing you know, Wizarding Britain is caught in a two-front war between Voldemort and his Death Eaters with their Pureblood Master Race ideals. And, with Grindlewald and his new followers with their desire to unite the Wizarding and Muggle Worlds, ideally with Wizards at the top, blood status irrelevant. With the possibility of other wizarding nations joining in on the war against Voldemort, as they're already giving chase to Grindlewald.

&amp;#x200B;

I find a wizarding war with three separate sides very interesting to think about. Like a Humans vs Aliens war that suddenly becomes a Humans vs Aliens vs Parasitic Aliens war.Food for Thought: What if Grindlewald escaped Numenguard the same time Voldemort came back and hears about both Voldemort and Harry Potter?"

0,"Hi there :)

In a previous ""thoughts"" post, I've mentioned how the existence of ""Aurelius"" Dumbledore crashes into not only the original timeline of the Dumbledore family's story, but also the chain of events it involved. 
I think there was a little much text and kind of vague in the title, so I'm going to summarize it here before first info for the next movie starts being disclosed :)


**Around 1890**

* Ariana is attacked and traumatized by several muggles, leading to her surpressing her magic from then on, creating an Obscurus - Percival attacks the muggles and is imprisoned, where he dies a few years later - leaving his wife to care for their daughter alone 

**1890 - 1899** 

* the family isolates itself to conceal Ariana's condition
* she bonds with Aberforth in particular, also since Albus is too distracted by his studies etc. 

**Summer 1899**

* Ariana attacks her mother while Aberforth (who could calm her down) is away - she dies, at the age of 48 
* Albus and Aberforth are left to care for her - first is frustrated, latter would even leave school to be there for her
* Grindelwald moves to Godric's Hollow - him and Dumbledore bond and start to make plans for their revolution
* the three of them get into a fight about Aberforth wanting to stay home with Ariana and the ideas for ""The Greater Good""
* a fight erupts, Ariana appears and dies from one of the spells, maybe even all three, hitting her - Grindelwald escapes


2 important points: 

* in CoG, Grindelwald uses a skull that says **1898** - at this time, he would have been 16/17, and it's likely the year he was expelled from Durmstrang - and the one before he moved to Godric's Hollow. It's possible that this skull belonged to one of his parents

* The chain of events above can hardly be changed - Percival needed to go to prison (and even if sucessfully escaping, would have had to hide forever) so his sons would have to stay home after his wife's death, which was caused by the Obscurus, which happened because the muggles attacked Ariana, and he attacked them - and all of this led to Dumbledore meeting Grindelwald, and ultimately, Ariana's death and the fight/breach with his brother - if only one more of his parents had been home, he would have been away travelling the world with Elphias Doge 


Biologically, there's no way Aurelius (*1901) can be related to this family - and honestly, all of it was important to turn Dumbledore into the person he is in Harry Potter - someone who has everything, but at the same time nothing, and just wants to be there for people who experience something like this from the world. It's a tragic, but interesting story, and I don't know what JK Rowling would change to make it ""work"".

0,"Okay, so not ALL the Second Salemers as Mary Lou is definitely dead and at least one of her daughters too, and I don’t think any of this will happen in FB3, but hear me out. 

I’ve always thought that the Shaw family had a lot of set up for very little pay off, narratively speaking. We learn about the family dynamics of this newspaper tycoon and his three sons, particularly Langdon. We see that he’s the second son, the least favoured. We see that he’s sick of his more successful brother being the favourite. Yet if he wasn’t in the film at all, what difference would it make to the narrative? Mary Lou could still have gone to speak to the Shaws, and brought her children, for the payoff of the moment where Henry Jr calls Credence a freak. But actually even this is a stretch - Mary Lou was rejected by the Shaws, if she’d never gone at all it wouldn’t change what happened. Anyone random no-maj we meet for two minutes could have insulted Credence only to be killed by his obscurus form. Mr Bingley from the bank might have been a good contender.

It is of course Henry jr who dies. But immediately afterwards, the focus is on Langdon knows that it’s ‘witches’. He barely seems to care that his brother just died, he looks almost righteous about it. If that weren’t enough, When Credence loses control over New York, we see Langdon literally LAUGHING. Therefore he hated his brother so much that him being killed is a happy memory rather than a bad one... Do you see what I’m getting at? Langdon was obliviated in the same way as Jacob was, Jacob who states in Crimes of Grindelwald that as it only erased bad memories, he was able to retrieve his memories of Queenie, Newt and Tina. By that logic, Langdon remembers too. He knows that he was right, he’s seen it with his own eyes, and he believed Mary Lou’s message even before the death of Henry jr.

This was all I had before two days ago, when Source Of All Sources @mauraleamy informed me that a plot leak from before Where To Find Them was released claimed that the second film would be ‘an all-out war between the Magical Congress of the United States and the Fanatical Second Salemers who aspire to destroy all wizards’. Certainly the plan for the second film changed since that, but doesn’t it make sense? After all, I personally have always thought it odd that with their paranoia about discovery, with their complete segregation laws, and witchhunts such as Salem being considered a national trauma to the point of having a statue of the Salem witches in their atrium, MACUSA would allow the continued existence of a group right on their doorstep saying Salem was a good thing and handing out leaflets to other no-majs telling them how to spot a witch, that the magical should die. Not unless it was you know, plot armour that they should be back later.

And without Mary Lou, the movement needs a new leader. One who’s seen what destruction magic can be capable of, one who wasn’t obliviated. The fact that he’s now got money and influence over the media being the sole heir of Shaw newspapers is just a useful bonus. He will be back with a vengeance for that all out war between wizards and muggles.Langdon Shaw and the Second Salemers will be back, a theory."

0,"Hi there :) 

During my research concerning the history of the Scourers, I came across an interesting overlap in their respective timelines ... and I think I've found *something* ... 

Enjoy :) 

I began to wonder if the Scourer's actions are the missing link I'm looking for when it comes to connecting Martha's line to Britain ... I mean, we definitly have an additional chance here, given that the Scourers were active until **1693** , before partly fleeing into muggle society ... 

Even more interesting, Martha Steward (reminder: Isolt Sayre's daughter, non-magic) was born around **1634** and went to live with her husband and the Pocomtuc tribe, presumably in 1651/1654  ... and we have no information on their ongoing life, other than the Pocomtuc tribes' alliance with the Wampanoag for *King Phillip's war* from **1675 - 1678** , when she would have been in her 40s - that she was alive during this war is, far as we have no information on an early death, seemingly canon ... 

Also, as we know, the remaining Pocomtuc, following the war, partly married into other tribes and settler communities ... both would work for a Scourer to hide from the law with non-magic people. And remember, it's implied Martha set herself loose from her family, and given the Scourer's criminal sucess, it's unlikely that most people would recognize them ... and Martha was non-magic, so, despite the Scourers also occasionally denouncing muggles as witches, not their target, so must likely wasn't warned directly about them by her family ... and again, it's implied they weren't in contact any more.

By 1693, side note, she was about 59/60. Most likely a grandmother.

Also, the Scourers became anti-magic extremists and, according to the article, even *murdered* magic children born to them - and I'd say they wouldn't have left even non-relatives in their communities alive ... so if one of Martha's grandchildren or great-grandchildren had turned out to be magic ... how would anyone around have been able to stop them?

..... unless someone reacted earlily enough and brought the child to safety/fled with it ... perhaps even to another country if the Scourer(s) in question were mad enough to go after them?

Or, more likely, for the chance of having another magic child that would be threatened by them? 

In this case, the mother would need some help, not only to escape them permanently, but also to survive as a non-magic woman of the time… 

... for example, Martha's magic family .... and this was **before** Rapport’s law forbid wizards the contact with muggles … 

... and although we don’t know exactly when Webster went to Scotland and got married, it’s unlikely that him, at this time being at least in his 70s, wouldn’t have done so already …  and he was an **auror** , so fully capable of protecting them.

I know you're going to say *""Why didn't they just seek refuge at Illvermorny?""* - and while it would have been safe, it would have meant never leaving the school grounds - for her, at least until her death, for her child(ren) for most of their lifes until they could be adopted by another family member and pass as ""orphans"" ... and even then, the Scourers being both experienced wizard traffickers, murderers and anti-magic extremists, wouldn't be unlikely to still trying to find them and ""finish what they started"" - especially if one of the Scourers were biologically related to them (father is difficult - in this case, maybe she didn't know about his past until he killed her first child while she was pregnant with the second, or the Scourer in question was a relative of her husband ... there's some story here, the point is that I don't think that she was married/impregnated against her will - this would be to dark for the WW).

All in all, fleeing to Europe was the easiest and safest option, as the chances were higher the Scourers would decide to just drop the subject after a while, especially for the chance that there wouldn't be another magic child, at least not from their family, and she was going to change their names ... plus, Webster was, accordingly, an auror, so he could keep them safe if someone came for them, no problem. 

I'm keeping this theory! It's literally going places :D

Edit:

Going places? How about **Massachusettes** ?

this state is not only the location of Illvermorny, the school of Martha's family, and a nearby settlement of the Pocomtuc tribe she moved to - but also of the **Salem Witch trials**

... which took place in **1693**, right when the Scourers began to escape persecution. 

And the society Mary Lou Barebone ( **canonically** descendant of a Scourer) lives in, call themselves the *Second Salemers*. 

I can barely breathe :D this is amazing!Martha Steward and the Scourer's history - a connection? (theory)"

0,"_________________________________________________________________________________________

""The Scourers were a band of rogue wizarding mercenaries who operated in what would become the United States during the 17th century.

Formed due to the lack of any form of wizarding governance and law enforcement in the New World, the Scourers began as a combination vigilante group and **bounty-hunting** service, tracking down both wanted criminals and anyone for whom a reward was offered. With time, they became increasingly corrupt and brutal, resorting to torture and murder. Eventually, they engaged in outright **wizard-trafficking** , and even turned innocent No-Majs over to witch-hunting Puritans in exchange for gold.

Some Scourers managed to evade being brought to justice by marrying No-Majs and integrating into No-Maj society. Their descendants had a profound impact on No-Maj-wizard relations in the centuries that followed. Some of their descendants, such as the Barebone family, acquired an intense hatred of all things magical.""

- HP Wiki (

_________________________________________________________________________________________

Hope you don't mind the copy - I just think all of this is more or less important :D 

In FB2, we meet *Gunnar Grimmson*, a bounty hunter &gt;!who eventually is shown to have joined Grindelwald and murders Irma Dugard at his orders!&lt; - and while he, also given the actor's heritage, doesn't seem to be American, I do wonder if there's a connection.

According to the wiki entry, the Scourers, once disbanded, had to escape international warrants, which several managed by entering muggle society... but once they were there, there's nothing that could have stopped one or two from escaping the country, especially if people were looking for them ... and Iceland, (Ingvar Sigurdssons home country) does seem to lend itself well to hiding permanently ... wizard societies are very small, and given the countries' low population (or the one of several countries in Scandinavia), hiding in the wilderness and passing on your skills to the next generation would have been possible. 

This isn't a lenghty theory, I just think this parallel between the history of the Scourers and Grimmson appearing is interesting. 

Also, one character mentioned in relation to the Scourers, aka identifying several Scourer-founded-families, was Theophilius **Abbot** - which is the third family name, after Goldstein and Boot, that we know to show up in both Britain and America.

I don't know what to make of this yet ... we know how Webster got to Britain (at least in principal), but I wonder if there are going to be parallels here too... 

Anyway, thank you very much for reading :)

Edit: 
Parallels! ... the Scourers were literally *trafficking* wizards XD 

Question is if they also sold people to witch hunters in Europe/Britain, but it makes sense ... the population of both witches and muggles in America back then wasn't big, so they may have expanded to, language-wise most favourably, Britain and Ireland - or just to the european ""market"", as it was just more profitable

Edit 2: And hell, if a wizard or two escaped the non-magic witch hunters (via wandless magic, either practised while in captivity or out of stress) - what would it matter to Scourers? They had their money, and it's not like the muggles could find or make them give it back. 

Plus, they could work masked or obliviate their faces from their victim's minds to stay anonymus. One of the victims who escaped is still possible to have had a larger role in bringing them down ... I want to know more :)

Edit 3:

hold on ... 

* **1693** - the Scourers are persecuted and assimilate into muggle society, establishing hatred against magic in the same year as **The Salem witch trials** 

* all of which took place in **Massachusettes** - the location of Illvermorny and Martha's home with the Pocomtuc

* one of the Scourers's descendants was Bartholomew Barebone, an ancestor to Mary Lou Barebone, who became part of the *Second Salemers*


I don't know what to make of this yet but there are connectionsGrimmson and the Scourers (theory)"

0,"We know that in his late teens, Newt took the blame for  Leta and was expelled from Hogwarts for “endangering human life with a beast.” 

Dumbledore advocated for him and the expulsion was never enforced; Newt left the school, but kept his wand. Presumably his OWL grades and a good reference were enough to secure him a place in the House Elf Relocation Office, before working with  Ukrainian Iron Bellies in WWI. 

According to the MACUSA Major Investigations Department (film prop) the beast in question was a jarvey and Newt apparently violated laws prohibiting the possession of the creature. 

But something doesn’t add up. A jarvey is essentially a talking ferret and the MoM classification suggests that a competent wizard (Newt!) should cope. In contrast, Hagrid was expelled for an incident involving an Acromantula (Basilisk)

I think it might be a cover-up and the incident involved another, more dangerous beast. Maybe something that Prof. Kettleburn (another creature-loving Hufflepuff) imported? 

Obviously, Hogwarts is located in the Scottish Highlands, but  there are a lot of references to Greek mythology in the series (and an American setting.)Is there a more likely option?

0,"New to the group, so I don't know how many times or if this was ever discussed, but since I watched the whole HP series + both FB films yesterday I can't stop thinking about the possibility of Snape being a descendant of Queenie and Jacob (and not in the way you think of).

Also before you read further, sorry for possible mistakes, english is not my first language.

Things that lead me to this theory are not only the occlumency/legelimency talent, which is obvious, and not only the Queenie/Prince paralel (which is actually not important for this theory), but mainly the story we saw so far. With Queenie joining Grindelwald, there is a hight possibility she or/and Jacob will die in one of the next films. If Queenie finds out she's pregnant and Jacob dies, she might (with the trauma around the magical world conflicts, war, her spouse/husband death) abandon magic and live without it, maybe even move to another country and remarry (and change a name). In the other scenario, if Jacob survives, Queenie gives birth to a baby and dies, Jacob is left with the baby and probably returns to his muggle lifestyle. Also, at the start of TCOG he said he always wanted to go to England, so he might even move there at the end of the films.
There is also a possibility they will both survive and end up living as muggles or they will both die and the child will end up in a muggle orphange/foster care.

As you probably already guessed, my suggested child is not Eileen, but of course Tobias. He could likely be a squib and think he's a 100% muggle since his parent's won't talk about it or they won't be around to tell him he's not. He can also transfer the passive gene of having a occlumency/legilimency talent to Severus (maybe that being a reason he had to learn himself and Queenie had it as a natural gift).

Now about the ages: Queenie is born in the 1903, Jacob in the 1900. The duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald happened in the 1945, ending the wizarding war (and possibly causing the end of the 2WW? dunno, we'll see, but I doubt there won't be any connection), and as we all know this is when the last film will be set, that's pretty obvious (the duel being the climax of the series is not only wished, but probably certain). There is no information about when was Tobias really born, but for him to be possible to have a child in the January of 1960, he would have to be around 20 years old, so born in 1930-40 (Eileen was born in 1930, so it's for your consideration if they would have a bigger age difference). I also don't think they would let Queenie have a child at the very end, since she will be 42 and there are not many movies with mothers older than 40. So my guess is Queenie gives birth in the 3rd/4th movie, set around 1930s, and she or Jacob (basically at least one of them, but possibly both) will survive till the end of the war (because knowing big franchise movies they can't kill two of the four main characters before the final movie).

The only think is - wouldn't Tobias remember his first years surrounded by magic? Maybe he and his parent/s will go into hiding or he will be put away for his safety (or possibly have an erased memory if some trauma [death of his parents] happened...)

So, what do you think? Is it completely off or am I being at least little logical?Queenie/Jacob Snape's grandparents?"

CRACKED! And the lineage of Credance (Aurelius) is….

…maybe – or possibly, so follow me for a just a moment. First, a few reminders which need to be voiced against the other widespread theories: One cannot return after crossing the Veil; Time-Turners are rearward of present time only; Azkaban inmates can be released; the deceased cannot bear children; and a little something similar to the Gryffindor sword. So, prepare for a strong stomach, and here we go.

Albus Dumbledore’s mother, Kendra (muggle born), died in 1899 at the fury of her daughter Ariana’s Obscurus (as modestly confirmed by Percival Graves \[Grindlewald\] in FB1). Ariana would later die that same year during the infamous 3-way Duel, making any genetic lineage to Aurelius non-existent two years after the fact; and neither Albus nor Aberforth could have possibly sired their own brother. This, in turn, introduces Credance, a.k.a. Aurelius Dumbledore, as a problem into the equation, who was born in circa 1901 and in the company of his alleged spinster aunt, an estranged pureblood named Honoria, at the time of the ship’s sinking. That year, 1901, Honoria was in magical terms a mere 74 years young (early midlife). Being pureblood, she would be in direct lineage alongside Percival (not Kendra) in the family tree. So, the trouble begins here, with no seemingly viable explanation to the sibling question between Albus and Aurelius.

Enter: Uther Pendragon!

JKR once said that Harry Potter was a “spiritual descendant” of King Arthur. Those familiar with the Arthurian legends (AL) may recall the union between that king’s father with his own sister (!). In a parallel world, and the current Harry Potter universe (HPU), I suggest that Percival Dumbledore was perhaps charm-seduced by his own sister (half-sister?), Honoria (while either incarcerated or released) after Kendra’s passing for reasons unclear (sinister?) and motivated by the usual family conflicts for power, wealth and/or magical pursuits. We know that Aurelius was later taken aboard the ship which sinking led to Honoria’s demise, while their flight to the USA was, of course, for the raising of Aurelius in secretum to later challenge the rest of the Dumbledore clan’s estate (if not the entire Wizarding World) once grown and able. But it gets much deeper than that – even “Percival,” the given name of Albus’ father, mirror’s Perceval, a knight of the Round Table; and if you think that’s shocking, Perceval the Knight had a sister who was the bearer of the Holy Grail! It all circles back to Percival Dumbledore and Honoria.

So, with all the parallels of the AL imaging into the HPU and FB, it appears that Aurelius represents Mordred, the son of an incest union between Pendragon and his half-sister Morgause (i.e., Percival &amp; Honoria), who would challenge his brothers (Albus &amp; Aberforth) for a yet undisclosed objective in the Wizarding World. Mordred would later be killed, which explains why the existence of Aurelius was closely guarded (and shameful) secret in the HPU. As an aside, let’s not forget that the surname “Potter” means a maker of pots, or – a cup, as in the Holy Grail. Consequently, Harry, as “the chosen one” later down the line in the universe, becomes the “cup” that holds the bloodline…and that bloodline is the sole, direct descendant of Ignotus Peverell and therefore the only true heir to the noblest of the three Peverell brothers of the Deathly Hallows (another parallel to Galahad in the Grail Saga who was the purist of the three brothers). Surely it’s just another coincidence that Harry married a Ginerva, while King Arthur married a Guinevere (and in yet another twist, the evil Voldemort has his double in the Arthurian legend as Vortigern).

This theory seems to work with certain Arthurian “chapters” into the HP and FB universes, though not as a direct copy of the entire saga, but just elements taken as the foundation for a magical world. Who knows, we may even find Aberforth to reflect King Arthur’s (read: Albus) foster-brother, the sharp-tongued and bullish knight named Sir Kay, who at times had conflicting loyalties to his brother – as has been the case between Albus and Aberforth.CRACKED! And the lineage of Credance (Aurelius) is…."

0,"Hi there :)

Blood-dammit! XD that's one of the thoughts coming to my mind recently

Andrewhy7 has pointed out to me correctly that I had missed info about the term ""half-blood"" aka that it's very strechable. The term can mean half-muggle half wizard, but also grandchild of a couple like this, or descendant. He also pointed out that muggles aren't effected by dragonpox, and while I wondered if a squib could be effected, I'd rather stick with this fact.

A lot of things make more sense now (why they were allowed in America) and I thank you for pointing it out to me.

However, my theory still stands with the evidence we have from Isolt's story and the canonical family tree. The options we have now, for the, to begin with, speculated line, are the following:

1. Mr. Goldstein - we know there are Goldsteins in Britain that ours are ""distantly"" related to, and Anthony Goldstein has been confirmed as ""half-blood"" as well, so we can assume that the muggle heritage comes from this side, also given Tina and Queenie identifiying as jewish. So, we either have a grandfather or a more distant relative. This take also includes that there are muggles in the Webster-Boot line, and I don't see why not :) 

This would rob Credence of being ""the first male wizard"" born to Isolt's/Martha's line, but - if it was his father, that wouldn't take much away from it - in fact, it would even explain why they'd be worried for someone to abduct their child following believing the prophecy, given all those they were descendant from, and especially adding the Boot line. But there's another option:

2. Hard to trace back - the family tree I added shows the end of a distance of 267 years, between the children of Isolt Sayre and ""our heroes"" - and suffice to say anything could have happened during this time. Martha's descendants spreading among several muggle societies, family arguments that led to parties abandoning the family all together, maybe even descendants being unaware of their heritage ... I don't know. What we have is confirmed non-magic blood in the family, and the existence of Goldstein


Anyway, at this point, I also want to apologize - I know you trust me with these informations and I'm trying really hard to always give an explanation that's plausible, that works ...  I'm sorry it didn't work. 

Also, I'm kinda getting signs of exhaustion right now, trying to keep the theories intact along with studying and work - so if you have some thoughts that could help with this theory, I'd like to hear them :) Maybe we really have to split things a bit, sometimes I don't see things literally to the side of my face :D

0,"In the screenplay Scene 67 flashes back 17 years to the last day of the winter term (the girl teases Leta about not going home for the holidays.) 

Newt and Leta are 13 at the time, so it must have taken place between February 1910-January 1911. 

But is this before the Easter holidays (2nd year) or the Christmas holidays (3rd year)? At our school, terms were referred to as autumn/spring/summer, so I’m a bit confused. 

I’m not-picking I know, but I only ask because McGonagall was a Professor at the time and I’m trying to figure out her exact age. 

Dumbledore was her transfiguration Professor when she was at Hogwarts; I’m inclined to believe he was her only teacher in the subject. 

I know that theoretically, Dumbledore could have started teaching at Hogwarts in September 1899, but I think it’s more likely he started in 1901 (after Aberforth turned 17 and graduated.) 

So, if McGonagall started in 1901, she wouldn’t have graduated until 1908 wouldn’t have started teaching until 1910 (Leta’s 3rd year.) Or is she perhaps a year older?Question re: Crimes of Grindelwald Flashbacks"

There it goes...

As you know, the Fantastic Beasts saga takes place just before the World War II. As farmas we know, Grindelwald is the representation of the nazi movement in Germany and around the world. 
In COW, when they are at the Lestrange Mausoleum they show them how big and dangerous the war will turn. It might seem like some kind of war between wizards and Grindelwald followers is coming. And in the end of his vision we can see the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. 

So, as history teached us, the atomic bomb represents the end of the World War II and something just came up into my mind. 

WHAT IF...? 
The atomic bomb is the Grindelwald vs. Dumbledore duel? In all the Harry Potter books there’s not information about the date or something but there’s some facts about the history pf Dumbledore and when i searched for that fact i found that the duel took place in 1945... THE SAME YEAR THAT THE ATOMIC BOMB WAS DROPPED IN HIROSHIMA! 

It’s curious that just before the FB saga came out in Pottermore Rowling revealed a map of all the wizarding schools around the world. 

We already know by Rowling that the Fantastic Beasts saga will take place in a lot of places around the world. FB3 will be in Rio and Germany. What if the final movie will take place in Japan, we know that there’s a school, Wahoutokoro. 

Let me know what you think, you can search for the dates too and you will see that it’s all connected.Dumbledore vs. Grindelwald FINAL BATTLE (theory)"

0,"Hi there :)

For the Illvermorny theory, I've discussed how the ability to understand/speak Parsel (or both, we'll get to that) runs in the family of Isolt Sayre ... and may do so in her possible extended line leading to Britain :) But her descendants may not be the only ones capable of it ... 

We know about Nagini being one from HP, of course, she's out first one - and she's going to play a big role in this theory :)

Enjoy :)


**Credence**

Throughout the second movie, we see that Credence has formed a close connection with Nagini ... while they both suffer from a sort of physical curse, of course, there may be more to their relationship than at first sight ... 

*thebosd* , a fellow redditor, has pointed out to me, that *all* conversations Nagini and Credence had in CoG may have been in Parseltounge, unbeknownst to him even - and when Nagini says something to Irma, there's a chance she hasn't heard her... we also agreed that the few conversations they have usually happen with no witnesses/noone who could tell if they speak in tounges - 

One thing we have to establish at this point is that, according to Harry (twice) and even Voldemort, Parselmouths don't realize it's another language when hearing the speech of a snake, **nor when they respond themselves** , unless someone points it out to them. And we know that, for example, Nagini can transform unintentionally when she's stressed, so maybe, on a less serious note, she sometimes slips into Parsel unintentionally mid-speech ... if Credence understands Parsel fluently, there's a chance he didn't even notice. And I wonder if she did - I don't think they dared to speak much when other circus staff was nearby, and when they were alone, it's possible that, slipping into Parsel both, noone could hear them ... plus, I doubt that Nagini would be very aware of occasionally slipping into Parsel if she does - unfortunately, we have to consider that she's not used to people at the circus, or in general, speaking to her much and/or wanting to hear much of an answer. 

We'll get to how Nagini speaking Parsel may play another role in a moment.

Plus, being able to speak to a snake may, interestingly, work as a reference to the Second Salemer's beliefs/their view of sin ... 


**Tina and Queenie**

Assuming them as descendants of Isolt too (and for this, I've seen too many clues by now) there's a chance they possess the ability to speak or understand Parsel as well ... especially since, at this point, we have to remember that it was Rionach IIs (Isolt's daughter) greatest fear that she might pass on this ability to her children, hence why she decided not to have any.

Three of her *sisters* descendants at once being Parselmouths, would be a very fitting and ironic turn of fate. 

Concerning our sisters, there's a chance that they were both unaware of this ability for most of their life, at least growing up, in North America ... unless they've had, for example, transfiguration or care for magical creatures lessons etc. where snakes were involved, there's a chance they never heard them speak. Also, Isolt Sayre herself could understand Parsel, so the ability may be less frowned upon in America. 

But it's likely that Tina, once moving to Britain, decided to keep this ability of hers (that she likely hadn't used for a long time anyway) a secret, so people at the ministry at least would not mistrust her. 

Concerning Queenie, I think she re-discovered this ability once moving to Nurmengard ... 


**Abernathy**


By the beginning of CoG, Grindelwald conjures a new tounge for Abernathy, presumably, for his services... but it's split, for no appearant reason. Unless he found out about Credence heritage/has had a vision of him bonding with Nagini via parsel. I believe, since Abernathy is kind of set up to return to the good side, he may have given him this ability to be able to bond with Credence, much like she did ... plus, this may be how Queenie (whether aware or not) may enter the conversation, understanding what they're saying ... also makes me wonder if Abernathy's conjured tounge makes him able to distinguish between human speech and Parsel. 

This also leads to something I've been wondering about for a while - whether we'll enter the next movie with the three of them having formed a close bond, also based on the fact that they can have conversations the other followers can't understand ... except for Grindelwald, of course.

I believe he learned this language the same way Dumbledore did ... JK Rowling once confirmed that he has a vague understanding of the language, but that it's not natural, just one of the languages he learned due to his intellect.

And I believe they may not be the only ones...


**Newt**

In his book, Newt mentions how the three heads of the Runespoor (which is also my nickname for the Nurmengard trio) usually have conversations in Parsel - and we know that the Horned Serpent uses this language too.

My prediction is now that Newt, having worked with Runespoors for years and even currently keeping one in his case (deleted scene FB1) learned a basic vocabulary and responses from the creature (which may be exactly how Dumbledore and Grindelwald learned it too) and can, by FB3, still communicate with Nagini when she's in snake form.

So far, it makes the most sense that she moved into his hospital after Paris, where she could transform safely at night and have as much of a normal daily one as possible - in my mind, she's even been Newt's assistant besides Bunty for the past few years the next time we meet her. 

It would even make sense that Nagini has since taken care of Runespoors, and taught both him and Bunty some more Parsel as time went on - maybe by saying a word, but saying the pronounciation to the creature, something like that.


Anyway, that's it so far :) I feel like Parsel is going to play a much larger role in the next movie.

I've posted a theory a while ago about the use of red and blue (and pink) as a symbol of where the respective characters stand/their arcs throughout the movies.

There seems to be a double meaning here :)


**Blue**

The primary colour in the uniform is currently used for the group forming around Tina (who also wore Ravenclaw's silver tones throughout the first movie), also worn by Yusuf and Nagini, and Newt, as he did originally wear an indigo coat - Isolt Sayre chose this colour to show her connection to the house of Ravenclaw/the one she would have chosen - and it does make sense for the group too, as they try to stay logical and reject Grindelwald's ideas - and peace, of course. In addition, we saw Queenie wear a blue dress in the first movie. 


**Red/pink (Cranberry)**

The colour used secondairly in the uniform has, as established, been worn before by Queenie and Credence, symbolizing their vulnerability which Grindelwald exploits - but in the history of the founding of the school, this colour also had a symbolizm as the one James Steward, Isolt's non-magic husband, chose (for his love for cranberry cakes ... I guess I don't have to explain the two parallels we have here to Jacob :)) 
Plus, it could be symbolic of going the opposite direction of the blue and trying to reach a different, less-segregated situation with the muggles (ideally the one in Britian and between Isolt and her husband, not Grindelwald's ideology and plans - in which the red could also be symbolic of blood). 

Also, Abernathy is seen wearing the colour, post pink, like Queenie ... I've said before that he may play a bigger role in the greater picture of Illvermorny's role for this story, and so far, he's the only additional follower we've seen going through these colour phasis (and, oddly, to **blue** by the end of CoG) - which could be symbolic of his development, sure, but I feel like it also holds this symbolizm of the school ... also, Kevin Guthire stated that his character will ""literally grow limbs"" in the next movie, which sounds a lot like reference to house Wampus ... we'll see :)


**Gold**

Students of Illvermorny wear, in addition to their uniform, a gold triskele brooch resembling the one of Isolt's mother - Tina's signature jewelry is a golden stone pendant that was very present in the first movie, and we see Queenie wearing golden necklaces too for CoG - not to mention that her hair is, literally, golden. 
And then of course, there's the name revelation of ""Aurelius"" (""golden one"").

0,"####From FB1 screenplay:

SCENE 1

EXT. SOMEWHERE IN EUROPE—1926—NIGHT 

**A large, isolated, derelict chateau emerges from the darkness.**

-&gt;a quick search for the meaning of **chateau** shows it being a derived from the French word château which mostly refers to a fortress or Manor house in France.

[Source](

Which means the fortress which we see in the [opening scene of FB1]( is somewhere in France, most probably.

But what is Grindelwald doing in France during that time? Wasn't he supposed to be in America at that time impersonating Graves?

Again, read this piece which Graves/Grindelwald says to Credence the following night after he attacked in Europe(France).

&gt;GRAVES

&gt;You’re upset. It’s your mother again. Somebody’s said something – what did they say? Tell me.

=&gt;The word ""again"" specifies, Grindelwald is well aware of Credence and his awful mother at this point.

So, what I'm saying is Grindelwald might have checked Credence's adoption papers during this time and would have seen the name ""Irma Dugard"" on it.

And that's the reason, why he visited France during this odd moment...to know about Credence..as who he was.

Most probably Irma knew that Credence was actually Aurelius Dumbledore (that's why she was killed later) so she would have told the whole story to Grindelwald as well.

I believe that's how Grindelwald became aware of Credence's identity. He knew his identity from the beginning of FB1.Was Grindelwald in France at the beginning of FB1? How Grindelwald found that Credence was Aurelius Dumbledore?"

0,"Link to the full track:




I know this sounds crazy, but I feel like, while this song does line up with the scene that we've seen of Leta finding the note, if you listen to it closely, it doesn't entirely ... the way it rises in emotion and uses bass, especially around 1:39, feels a lot different ... 

And you barely notice because it's held *very quietly* ... it's a surprisingly feeling arrangement for a scenerie where Leta, and then Tina and Newt mostly discover that the family tree of the Letranges has been moved - it does matter to the plot, sure, but something is odd... I think, especially for Leta, this revelation would rather be unsettling, and have fitting music ... 

And then, there's also the notion of what just happened in the literal background - aka Newt and Tina just having discovered that, not only was there no engagement, but she also understood the compliment he made to her in it's full meaning... while they're running, the conflict has been resolved, they're ready to start dating where they left off. 

Plus, the entire track also includes the theme of their goodbye in NY ... idk, listening to it like this, it feels like, at 1:02, *something new is starting* 

... plus, the bass drop we hear at 1:39 and the following crescendo sounds a lot like a kiss scene. 

I'm not sure, but I feel like this is going to come back in the next movie - I believe this part of ""Salamander eyes"" is foreshadowing an incoming new/final version (much like the new version of the goodbye theme that makes the first half of it) that makes up the theme of their first kiss ... 

J. N. Howard is certainly planning something as far as I can hear :D

Edit: Firstly thank you for all the likes :) 

Secondly - Leta, to Newt, is Salamander-eyed too. In the scenes she shares with Newt, there are specific shots with her eyes, her looking at him, really in focus ... maybe that's also why the music faints around her as the scene goes on, aka as he's taking up the threads with Tina where they left of""Salamander eyes"" is hiding something ..."

Queenie is born in 1903, Tina in 1901. 
The first movie is set in 1926. 
The H1N1 Influenza Pandemic of 1918 (sometimes known as the “Spanish” Flu) would put Queenie and Tina at somewhere around 15 and 17. 

In FB1, Queenie mentions that they are orphaned because their parents died of dragon pox as “kids”. 

Now, I am 28F and I still refer to myself as a kid for all the years before I moved out at 25. 

Could there have been a magic variant of illness, Dragon Pox, that swept the wizarding world at the same time? 

Just a thought. Sorry if this is a repete of someone’s older post.Could Queenie and Tina’s mention of their parents dying of the Dragon Pox when they were kids a nod to the 1918 H1N1 pandemic?"

&amp;#x200B;

I got some ideas:  


1. Theseus - Set before the events of first Fantastic Beasts movie, he sets out to track down the rising movement of Gellert Grindelwald through the help of Percival Graves.
2. Lestrange Saga  - The first horror entry in the WW, it follows the Lestrange family and their quest to gain influence in pureblood society. Tone is similar to HBO's *Lovecraft Country* and Jordan Peele's *Us* combined with story beats of *Succession.* 
3. The Greater Good -  A ministry of magic employee is tasked to infiltrate Grindelwald's cause to gain information that will shape the global wizarding war.

I'd like to hear your show suggestions and pitch. The IP has been controversial and divisive but there's so much potential if done right. And who knows, if WB manages to get talented creatives as Favreau and Filoni, WW could win over old and new fans like The Mandalorian did with The Star Wars franchise.After seeing recent Disney+ Marvel and Star Wars lineup, the Wizarding World IP has some potential to follow that route"

0,"Assuming that Credence is actually being lied to and he's just a random guy Grindelwald manipulated into thinking he's a Dumbledore, how do you think he'll find it out?  Do you think he'll find out in 3 or 4/5? I think he'll find out in 3 that he's been lied to and then find out who he really is in 4 or 5. 

I think the set piece in Berlin is the key. This is all speculation at this point but I wonder if the set pieces comes before or after he finds out. Will he swap sides when he finds out or fight both Dumbledore and Grindelwald? 

Will Dumbledore tell him he's not his brother? Will he find out some other way? 

I wonder where it comes in the narrative. I don't think we'll end on another Credence cliffhanger.

My crack theory is that he seeks out Aberforth and starts going into some spiel about how he's his brother and Aberforth says ""WTF man? What has my actual brother's crazy ex done this time?"" but I don't think we'll get that lmao. Tho I think he'll be in the movie.How do we think Credence will find out he's been lied to for a long time? How will he react?"
0,"A while ago, after watching the take of *Film theory* on indoctrinations techniques used within movies, I’ve realized that this is also (unsurprisingly) what we see Grindelwald do in CoG. 

The way he manipulates may not be him only adapting to a situation on the spot and regarding people that specifically ... he seems to follow the usual programm steps of cult indoctrination, aka thought reform or reprogramming. 


We’ll focus mainly on Queenie, Credence and Abernathy for this theory, as, aside from his henchman Krall, among the current set of close followers, they seem to be most at the receiving end of his methods. Plus, they fit the description of people statistically drawn into cults – individuals who are lonely, lack self-confidence, are gullible to a degree, due to experience .. in general, people who are in a vulnerable state – all traits we see in our targets. 


Plus, the leaders of such cults are usually very charismatic and knowledgeable of what moves people - and take note of the almost continuously sad and serious expression Grindelwald maintains throughout CoG: he always seems conflicted about his actions, not just to the audience, but to his followers as well – and he knows this. It’s a calculated act to maintain a feeling in his face that awakes not only their compassion, but also reliance on him, as he always seems to be 100 % serious about their mission and the stakes. – check of the century. 

Let’s get to the steps he follows.


* Getting the target to say “yes” to a non-threatening event - this included getting Credence to talk to him while masking as Graves, then sonly building an positive bond with him – also, Rosier invites Queenie to tea, then they let her go. Plus, he got a ton of people to agree to listening to public speeches of him, long before Paris ... him speaking to people at all became so dangerous that the MACUSA saw no other way than to remove his tounge - and this is also where I remembered something I was told personally back at school, when we talked about modern cults: the rule was to *never* agree to even a single conversation with them, as the thought reform process started right there.


* Love bombing – Grindelwald supports Credence, offers him a way out, the safety of himself and his sister, heals his wounds and shows him the affection and attention he's desperate for, even offers to teach him magic. Also, cults sometimes welcome members with gifts – that’s where the deathly hallows pendant comes in. And notice what he says: ""I'd trust very few with this. Very few."" It's a *textbook* example of cults establishing a feeling of specialty, of being valued, to their targets. Later on, him and Rosier show Queenie a similar warmth, the one she’s currently lacking due to the difficulties with her sister and Jacob – and, after all, she grew up orphaned and it’s likely her abilities make friendships difficult in general, leave alone properly holding down a job. Plus, very importantly - Grindelwald uses specialized language, especially when it comes to his new ""targets"" - when speaking to them, he usually says ""I want (...) for you."", showing empathy for their needs and presenting himself as a friend - but among his followers, he uses ""We want (...)"" almost exclusively, assembling them verbally as a unity for his cause, and for them to feel like it. This is also where he establishes and Us vs Them mentality, which we seem him also express at the Lestrange crypt.


*  Dangling the prize in front of them – we haven’t seen much of it yet, but you could consider Grindelwald offering Credence a relief and Queenie a chance to marry Jacob – also, he offers them, along with his followers, a chance to stop the incoming war … not simply a “higher” purpose, but an *urge* to act (we'll get back to this in a moment when it comes to working with guilt). Plus, there is an undisclosed scene of Queenie talking to Grindelwald in a rose garden in Paris, then being left alone to her thoughts – which I believe was what actually led her to telling Jacob they should “hear him out” – which leads us to the next step: 


* Getting an agreement from the target that they want the prize – this is spot-on what we see by the end of CoG, when both targets literally walk through a fire which reacts to their desire to join – we also get this in the first movie, with Credence agreeing to do what “Graves” wants him to do because he depends on the relationship they’ve formed thus far, even agreeing to meet him after dark when he knew this was likely to end in punishment from Mary Lou 


* Shutting down disent by threatening to withhold the prize – while we haven’t seen this with Queenie and Credence yet, we can clearly see it used on Krall, his henchman, when he starts asking questions – latter is also used to showcase to his followers what literally will happen to those who don’t fully appreciate the Greater Good’s ideals/plans – plus, there is a chance that Abernathy has gone through this too, as, given the sacrifices he readily made by the start of CoG, it seems he’s on a different level of being controlled already – which we’ll come back to in a moment 


* The establishment of guilt – we see this most prominently in the scene where Grindelwald presents what the future holds “if they don’t take action”, both for the muggles and the wizarding world, seeing how they'll sonly develop weapons of mass destruction – he intents to make the wizards around, especially those with special abilities and the aurors, feel a need to act – and he knows it’s possible, since wizards (among them Theseus) have defied orders before in WWI to protect muggles from … each other … plus, coming back to Abernathy, he may have been manipulated via guilt as well – aside from, as becomes clear in the first movie, him only pretending confidence, it’s also worth noting he seemed to live his job at international cooperation, being head executive young already – and beside the usual “your name written in glory if you do this”, he may have also agreed due to the vision of the future – and just being told the same as the viewers in the Lestrange crypt, aka that both worlds were in danger if nothing was done. Plus, the following steps being completed would give us an actual close to real life explanation of why he was ready to make the sacrifices we know about for the Greater Good. 


* The carrot and the stick – this we have seen barely at all yet, but I do think Grindelwald isn’t unfamiliar with this method, which includes conditioning the target by rewarding “good” behaviour and punishing “bad” behaviour – I do wonder if Grindelwald uses this technique at all when it’s easier to present himself as a saviour to his targets who’s determined to treat them differently than the world they’ve escaped from to keep them emotionally dependent – or he has certain followers assigned to keep others in line firmly by using this method. 


* Controlling the target’s contacts, resources and identity – exactly what Grindelwald does by the end of CoG. He gives Credence a new name (which some cults are known to do), and has successfully isolated him, Queenie and Abernathy from everyone they know – he also controls their resources, living in Nurmengard (and not just living, you could count in the wand he gives Credence and Abernathy’s tounge). You could even say that this could mean Credence starts to, after all of this, completely accept his presented identity as Aurelius, because, as far as he’s concerned, this is the best it gets for him – although we saw him still insecure about his decision (and we see what Grindelwald does about it - he establishes an enemy and their cause/himself as ""the good side"") he has affection, attention, contacts, a place to live, a name, even something like a purpose - and the safety he couldn't have for all his life thus far. And, except for relationships he may form with Queenie and Abernathy independently, it’s all tied to his loyalty to Grindelwald – and can be taken away. 


But there is one more thing we have to consider :

Grindelwald differs from usual cult leaders in that the true plans he has have *nothing* to do with what he tells his followers. We know, canonically, that he has no intention of stopping WWII, and that the goal we know about is his personal one of getting to the top, of establishing himself in the highest position of power possible and, in a way, old-fashioned world domination. He wants to shape the world the way he pleases, and he knows how to get people to do it for him. 


Anyway, that's my take. It's pretty interesting ... tell me if you have anything to add, I'm pretty sure there's more examples of Grindelwald manipulating people that I haven't mentioned yet.

And thank you very much for reading :)

Edit: If Abernathy should turn out to be Corvus V, and Grindelwald had revealed this to him (maybe even having been the one to rescue him as one possible ""Great Avenger"", we'd have another case of control of identity and working with a new name.

0,"something I've been thinking about for CoG:


Nagini doesn’t have many lines throughout, and neither does Credence … for most of their scenes (majority together), they’re both mute unless it’s absolutely necessairy … which I think is actually pretty great in the context of this story ... 


* Growing up with the Salemers, Credence most likely got used to never speaking unless directly adressed - and I think she lived a similar life, in which staying silent meant keeping herself as safe as she could from the people around her 

* Throughout their scenes, there’s barely anything spoken beyond single sentences, but dialogue is replaced by acting and gestures towards each other - they cuddle when sleeping, she touches his face, he kisses her hand, she holds his arm and kind of leads him through the streets, etc. Their relationship, at least a very close bond, is expressed, and explained, completely silently.
I think this is even a take on the reality of relationships - there rarely is as much to say between people as we see in movies generally - and seeing how a relationship can work on only showing what you feel instead of exposition is pretty refreshing :) for filmmaking and acting, it’s top game

* We get something even more like this with Kevin Guthire/Abernathy in this movie, who only gets a few lines in the beginning and, technically, his character has none at all for the entire movie - yet you can always tell how he’s feeling (thoroughly insecure usually, with nothing left of the man he tried to be in FB1)

* The opposite, when characters do talk to each other in this movie, it leads to misunderstandings quite a few times … and Grindelwald’s campaign is largely based on compelling people via words, and gaslighting them … so much so that the MACUSA removed his tounge O__O

* Small adding, this is during the era of silent films :)

0,"I used to think it was kind of out of character for him to try and arrest Newt in CoG, but in context, it started to make sense... 

* he knew Grindelwald was in the city - who had tried to kill his brother twice already in NY, so he was determined to get him out of his reach when he could
* he had initially warned Newt about the ministry surveilling him (noone forced him to leave the country)
* a little unfair maybe, but I've been wondering if he had convinced Travers by this point to give Newt a second chance at working with them upon his arrest, or propose prison ... yes, that's strongarming him into their alliance, but 

1. he couldn't do more for him than convince Travers they definitely needed him this much in the fight against Grindelwald
2. they do need him in this fight, and I think Theseus is equally nervous and grateful for every help as Travers
3. I think he even wants Newt around for the hunt so he'd be better protected, not just by him - if he was constantly out and about, the chances of him getting killed or abducted would be infinitely higher, especially since it would be logical to use him as a hostage against Theseus - that's also my theory when it comes to why he employed Leta at the auror's office - not just so she could get to know his years-long colleagues/friends better, but also so she'd be safer for the same reasons as Newt


Plus, I think the reason he wasn't shown again post Tina tying him to a chair (I doubt that he couldn't get himself free that long) was because he may have realized Newt was very well guarded already ... he's aware of his own power, and there was an auror on his level - plus, maybe he realized too that, no matter how much he tried to convince himself they needed to do this to win the war, it still didn't feel right to force Newt to work with themThought's on Theseus' scene at the french ministry"

0,"recently realized that Tina, Queenie, Credence and, likely, Abernathy too each have traits, history and connections to at least two houses of Illvermorny each, and it kind of builds a circle ...


Credence: Horned Serpent, Thunderbird

Tina: Thunderbird, Pukwudgie

Queenie: Pukwudgie, Wampus Cat 

*Abernathy : Wampus Cat, Horned Serpent* (his house is yet to be confirmed)


Now, it got me thinking: the founders of Illvermorny were a family of pure - and muggleblood, and two adopted sons ... so maybe, if Illvermorny comes up in the story (and after my 9th edit to the theory, I'm pretty sure) the people required for a certain task must be of the same blood (aka halfbloods in our case) and one of an additional line that isn't related ... 

So, if they all are potential ""Great Avengers"" who return to the school - and he is named ""Corvus"" (raven) and was rescued from the sea ... then that would make him ""Wings from the water"".


Edit:

... the original first generation after Isolt were the twins Martha and Rionach, and the brothers (2 years apart) Webster and Chadwick

* equal numer of women and men 

* Tina and Queenie are two years apart

* Credence and Abernathy are, if the theory is correct, the same age, maybe even pretty exact, too

**Tina**

* Thunderbird (her house and Illvermorny and definitly a connection to the incidents of New York, Newt and her overall spirit) 

* Pukwudgie (her sister's house and, interstingly, said to be able to transform into a porcupine by legend, the offical sigil refers to this too - ""porpentine"" is another word for the porcupine family)

**Queenie**

* Pukwudie (her house, and said to have healing powers - she definitly wants to help people via her skill)

* Wampus cat (legend says it has the power of Legilimency)

**Abernathy**

* Wampus cat (Kevin Guthrie says his character will literally grow limbs in the next movie - and his house hasn't been revealed yet). Plus, by the beginning of CoG, he fights against two high-ranking aurors and the head of incarceration of the IFW) - also, this would be his connection to Queenie, as the first movie stronly implied he has unrequited feelings for her 

* Horned Serpent (his split tounge/maybe ability to speak parsel now - btw, this could connect him to Credence as well, as, given his connection to Nagini, there's a chance he understands or even speaks parsel (see Illvermorny connection theory ;))

0,Who is “Creedence Barebone”? Is it really Aurelius Dumbledore or has JK got another trick up her sleeve?
0,"Think this is almost on the brink of not worth mentioning, and yet it kind of is ...

I feel like the end of FB3, it's the first time Credence is in a place with **running hot water** . 

Think about it: the Second Salemers probably had the bare minimum in sanitary installments, likely the bottom-of-the-barrel outside shacks and cold water taps of the working class in NY - either for financial reasons or by choice to, as fundamental christians, reject anything remotely luxurious. And life at the circus probably didn't provide hot water for the employees either. 

So, idk, I always picture him looking around his new living quarters and being, aside from the prospect of three meals a day if he likes, in most awe of having a bathroom to his own, with a fancy tub O_O 

(wizards can clean themselves magically, but even Hogwarts has heated bathrooms - wizards don't deny themselves that) 

I like to believe that Queenie reads his mind or talks to him and realizes that he's never had this before, which she finds very sad, but also uplifting, seeing how much he enjoys his bathroom and the option to take hot baths to relax and warm up whenever he wants. 

Idk, it's kinda nice :) Perhaps even something he'll miss once leaving Nurmengard again. But hey, he doesn't have to cut it down that much, especially given his past, I don't think anyone will argue. 

TL;DR: Credence finally gets to enjoy running hot waterFunny micro-detail about the movies thus far (spoilers)"
0,"When Grindelwald says 'Do you think Dumbledore will mourn for you?' he then throws a massive amount of blue/black fire at Newt, who is able to withstand it. Just before Theseus takes a step down to help his brother, we know Theseus is a war hero and a powerful auror. If he hadn't done that would Newt have been toast? or could Newt have hold him off by himself?[Spoilers] Did Theseus save Newt's life?"

0,"I've checked: it takes Grindelwald almost exactly **3 1/2 minutes** to carry out his escape plan. (feel like this was intentional)

Meaning about 4 Minutes after the chariot went out of sight for the MACUSA, Mr. Spielman showed back up in the room.

Meaning Madame Piquery didn’t even make it halfway back to her office (!) - before getting the news of several deaths and her head of international cooperation’s role in the whole affair - from the soaking wet and injured head of incarceration of the IWC. 

I feel like she involuntairly, snapped “NO!” just when he came up to her. 

TL;DR:


9:00 p.m. : 

*Spielman and the aurors leave the MACUSA headquarters, with Grindelwald by chariot, calm, everything’s going according to plan*


9:04 p.m. :

**Spielman and a few survivng aurors stumble through the head quarters, injured and and in shock, not bothering to dry up themselves even while sending the next employee they meet for Madame Piquery**


Plus, can you imagine the chaos in the ministries in europe shortly after?

Like, did the MACUSA manage to inform the people waiting for the chariot in time or did they just wait and then, as it was more and more delayed, slowly realize something went terribly wrong?

And the brits! Just imagine Theseus having a nice dinner with Leta to try and forget that Grindelwald was going to be brought to europe tonight (a pretty risky endavour, but hey, precautions had been taken no end, right?) ... when getting a patronus message from Travers to get to the ministry **now.**


Plus, Tina must have been summoned too that night ... to, the next day after hours of attending meetings on the MACUSAS next steps, inform Queenie and those at the department for international magical cooperation who hadn’t been involved in trying to send Grindelwald to europe why Mr. Abernathy hadn’t shown up this morning ... 

About him - I wonder if it'll come up one day that he not only helped Grindelwald escape, but also attacked and bit the head of incarceration of the ICW ... I guess no one can mess with people as skillfully as someone trained in international business XD

Edit: Imagine Spielman talking about injuries throughout his career XD 

""I have a scar on my shoulder from a devil's snare - it may or may not have effected that they're not used for prison gates any more - one on the other from an attack with explosive potion in 1913 - and oh yes, beneath my watch, there's an detailed dental impression of the former head of department for international magical cooperation of the american ministry of magic. In case he ever tries to live under a false identity, he should probably avoid dentists...""Something hilarious about Grindelwald's escape"
0,"In crimes of grindelwald the wizards are scared by a mere nuke that is 1000 times weaker than the Tsar Bomba. 

And even in the Middle Ages, despite having billions of times less power, muggles still forced wizards to some extent, to escape and hide.

Compare that to a wizard in Neolithic times, I am pretty sure an ancient warlock or chief would be more than capable of fighting on par with any modern wizard. Herpel the fowl would likely be a match for any modern wizard. 

If spells like prophecy, and Harry’s protection and blood link are so powerful, as to trump Voldemort and Dumbledore easily, than once the singularity arrives, or even just exponential technology, and muggles start increasing their power output by billions of times, what will wizards do?

Once muggles gain the ability to manipulate quantum probability, use super ai made from fluctuations from the subatomic interactions of reality itself, and derive knowledge about the laws of physics, or even learn to control the flow of space time, what will wizards do?

If wizards have not improved by even a mere million times in the last ten thousand years, even if Grindelwald wins, or Voldemort, in a few million years a dinosaur astroid, or a supernova would easily wipe the planet, resetting life.

If magic could stop prehuman dinosaurs and magical creatures from dying out, what will stop wizards?

In the long term the universe doesn’t care whether or not you have magic, you just need to be able to survive. And if you can’t find a way to fight off supernovas, continent level disasters, then it would be hard to live well.

If wizards have stagnated so much in the last few millennia, what makes people think they would improve.

Do you think individual wizards would all surpass Voldemort in the next few decades through magical innovation? 

Because that is the level of technological growth they need to match to keep up with muggles. 

If the average wizard doesn’t have all the knowledge of Merlin, Voldemort, Dumbledore, all the founders, the peverells, in the next few decades, than it would prove that technology is not contested by magic at all.


Edit: For people saying magic stops technology making them incompatible, in lore, the disturbance is caused by mites that feed off of energy. The concentration just makes electronics with low power malfunction.

If you have a super AI, that runs on quantam levels, if anything, the magic itself would fizzle out.Wizards are lagging behind"

0,"recently realized something about a specific triat that most men we see in Fantastic Beasts share ... they have little to no pride. 

Most stereotypical men in cinema, especially those often critizised, are usually defined by how their (often natural- talent-based) confidence, or one they've usually learned, stands between them and others - or the prospect of accepting help, and/or admitting that there is something they struggle with/being open about themselves. Or how their pride constantly affects, usually worsens, their life, each time they find themselves dissapointed by their own presumed abilities.

The easiest way to explain it is to compare Newt and Theseus to Loki and Thor in MARVEL - there are some paralells *at first sight* , but the closer you look, the more you realize that the Scamander brothers are each on a level the Odinsons are yet to reach.

Loki's main problem is that he's desperate for a purpose, most simply a way to find appreciation for both his skills and his persona - Newt, meanwhile, by the time we meet him, has found his purpose (and has so long ago) and though he struggles to find appreciation from people, he doesn't depend on it - he's found his purpose in caring for animals and sharing his knowledge of them, and he's already dedicating his life to it - and though forming relationships isn't easy for him, he usually remains polite and caring to others, and asks for their advise/works with them instead of assuming a leader position - this is also how he differs from the architype of ""loner genius"", who's usually defined a lot by being outspokenly indifferent to less smart people's feelings and, again, riddled with pride. 

In Theseus' case, we have a very similar story - he dedicates his life to a purpose, one he knows precisely he's right for (Thor's case was different, sure, being king is something much more complicated) - but he's humble already, and unashamed of his feelings (kissing his fiancee and hugging people in public) - and always tries to avoid a fight, even disobeying direct orders from Travers. He's dedicated to making sure people are alright, always ready to put any own interest he might have aside in favour of achieving a greater good - even if that means working with a bounty hunter, to kill Credence. He doesn't like it, he admits freely, but it needs to be done. 

Also, there's Yusuf and Jacob - while we don't get to know Yusuf as a person entirely, we know he's no less serious and honest than the other men we meet, and, in all he does, just trying to survive - this actually leads to another interesting trait of the men we meet - there's simply no reason or space in their life for hubris, they have more important things to care about. This becomes especially clear when he discloses his life story, the pain over his mother's death and how his father was consumed by grief and anger, not just with Leta, but also people he's just met whom he wants to know, since he's imprisoned them for a reason he's open about now, and since they saved his life. Plus, he would have been a brother to Leta, this becomes clear. 

Jacob, actually, spells out the no-pride situation in both movies for himself - he wants to open a baking business, not for money or appreciation, but to make people happy ... and though he tries to be seemingly proud at the Speakeasy, he later on paddles back, and tells Queenie she'll find tons of men like him ... in FB2, he's even fully ready to let her go and find someone else, if she'll be safer for it. And though he reacts badly to Queenie calling him a coward, (it may rather relate to some experiences in WWI) he doesn't hold onto it. Plus, when Newt asks him what he should say to Tina, he could have given him something stereotypical - but no, just say what comes to your mind when you see her. 

And then, of course, there's Dumbledore - he hides his feelings, sure, usually, but when it comes to Grindelwald, he's honest - maybe because he couldn't hide these feelings even if he tried. Plus, even when he does hide, he's not condescending - he remains polite and attentive to how the other party feels. He's a difficult case for sure, but I like how he's not a stereotype loner genius either - he tries to help people with his abilities rather than showing them off, involves and relies on the abilites of others in his plans - and we know how his intelligence is a massive burden, especially when it comes to relatioships, which he yet doesn't let on. 

There's also Abernathy - we see him being angry at Tina for disobeying orders, but that was his job... and we see him showing feelings and a caring side, pretty clearly, for Queenie. Plus, though we don't know what Grindelwald promised him, we see him, voluntairly, at rock-bottom as a prisoner in TCOG, then, all throughout the following movie, nervous and scared, mute even. If Grindelwald has promised him glory like he did Grimmson, it's likely that his pride and self-destructive dedication to it is leading him on this path. It's an interesting flip to what other men in this story are doing. 

Last but not least, even Travers kind of falls into the category of fighting for a purpose and accepting/even asking for help from the outside when he goes to Hogwarts and, ultimately, actively begins to work with Dumbledore, setting his harsh ways aside after what happened in Paris so there's no more damage

So yeah, another point I like about Fantastic Beasts :)


Edit: I forgot one very imporant detail - most men we've met so far actively cry, frequently - we don't know if Yusuf does in the scene we see of him alone in the bathroom (hey - parallel to Malfoy!) but it's very possible ... plus, interestingly, while Newt and Jacob cry several times, Theseus, in his scene, even whimpers - something not often seen with characters in general in cinema (when they do, it hits). 

Plus - I forgot Credence. 

His story included abuse committed by a woman on a man, and finding oneself completely at the mercy of others when it comes to your life and circumstances ... and he needs help to survive, probably more than any other character in this story. Plus, we see him being defended by a woman too (Modesty, Tina, Nagini) several times, and though we don't learn much about him as a person, from what we see from interactions with them, he's very trusting and equal with them. Just like with the others, there is no reason for him to treat them differently - his sisters were the only friends he had growing up. About his personality, btw, it's interesting... given the norm structures for storytelling, he'd be a protagonist, and his personality  central (in a good story that is) - only it seems that, in the years of living with the Second Salemers and his Obscurus, he couldn't really develop many of the traits that define a person, such as interests, intellectual abilites, wishes for the future ... he's good-hearted, this we've seen, interested in magic, and will stand up to people to protect others - but much of who he is is still hidden or yet to develop in a surround where he can. 

And then, there's also Grindelwald.
Grindelwald is difficult in most ways like Dumbledore, but most prominently, he uses showing emotions to people he wants to manipulate. Perhaps he's even aware that they're not used to a man speaking his mind this way, and are thus more affected by it as it gives them a feeling of being trusted in a way ... besides, the way he shows emotions also works for the finale of TCOG, where, having given his orders, he walks away - not with a manic smile, but with what seems to be regret for sending someone into the fight against Dumbledore. It almost feels like they both can't hide their complicated feelings for each other well.how men in FB differ from stereotypes (thoughts)"

0,"I think we can all agree that FB3 is a make it or break it moment for the franchise. Obviously we all want the movie to succeed commercially and critically. However, the franchise is definitely vulnerable at the moment with the less than stellar reception of FB2, Johnny Depp leaving and JK's recent controversies. I'd like to say FB2 was an anomaly for the franchise, but there's a lot that could go wrong for FB3. As we have seen with the DC films, WB may be tempted to over correct the franchise. So if FB3 flop at the box office as well as receive poor reviews despite studio intervention like bringing Kloves back as screenwriter, what will WB do next, especially when it comes to FB4/5? My thought would be that WB may want to finish the franchise by using HBO Max for the last two movies as it would be less riskier after FB3 flopping. Or, it could cancel both films which would be sad. I don't know about you guys, but I am definitely nervous for the franchise's future. Let's hope FB3 will get the franchise back on track.What will WB do if FB3 flop?"

0,"Hi there :)

following pottyaboutpotter1s theory, I researched the history of Illvermorny and sought parallels to our story - the result is probably the longest I have ever written, and it's just bullet points XD 

Enjoy :) Here's all the hints I found so far to Tina, Credence and Queenie not only being Peverells - but descendants of Isolt Sayre, the founder of Illvermorny ... actually, if I'm right, of all the founders of Illvermorny!


**1. Parallels to Queenie's story**

* 1603/1903 – Isolt Sayre, Queenie born (exactly 300 years apart)
* 1627/1927 – Founding of Illvermorny/Incidents of Paris
* Rionach = ""Queen"" = Queenie
* Gormlaith (her sister/Isolt's aunt) = blue (more soon) “Princess”
* Isolt may be derived off “Isolde”, who, in the tale of Tristan and Isolde, is a royal who later becomes queen 
* Queenie was house Pukwudgie (we'll get to this, it's a connection to Tina)
* Chadwick and Webster Boot, Isolt's adopted sons, were 2 years apart, like Tina and Queenie
* her Parents died too - from the memory we see, possible when she was three years old too. The official cause was dragon pox, but … look it up, this disease has been used multiple times to kill people – especially since a dark magician rescues her at some point too – the family has a connection to the Boot family, to the branch in Britain too – somewhere in these 300 years, there was “Albert Boot” – who succeeded Eldritch Diggory, who is strongly implied to have been assassinated via dragon pox to stop him from reforming Azkaban. Grindelwald tended to Queenie, much like Gormlaith tended to Isolt – in Isolts case, it’s the same person who killed her parents 
* (I have a theory that, finding out there was a second Peverell child/possible Great Avenger, he killed their parents to destabilize her and, one day, pull her to his side more easily - only he massively underrestimated who Tina would become)
* they're both against wizard-muggle separation and have a non-magic partner
* Queenie’s birthday is the 6th of January, the day of the Feast of Epiphanies – and the story of Hannukah involves an emperor called Antioch Epiphanus (Antioch, like the eldest Peverell brother)
* She wears blue at one point (we'll get to that) but usually, a lot of pink and red – the other of the colours of Illvermorny – relating to the non-magic husband of Isolt, James. and golden jewelry, like the students
* Rionach Steward was ashamed of her ability to understand and speak Parsel, so chose not to have children … Isolt could understand the language – Queenie also has a gift that enables her to hear things others can’t, but is mistrusted for it


**2. Parallels to Tina's story**

* Rionach II, one of the twins, taught defense against the dark arts 
* Webster Boot, the brother who went to Britain and may be an ancestor to her mother (the Boots were adopted, but we'll get in a moment to why this may matter) was an auror 
* Isolt retrieved a golden piece of jewelry from the ruins of their house, one of her mother , who was a Peverell – and note the three-parted piece– it’s highly likely that Tina’s golden pendant is her mother’s, since she’s not seen wearing any other and it’s literally a golden stone
* Knowing of Gormlaith, Isolt,Rionach II – how likely was it that a man would be this family’s great avenger?
* Chadwick and Webster were two years apart – like her and Queenie 
* “Porpentina” is an odd name – until you connect it to “Antioch” “Rionach” and that it’s another word for “Porcupine”, one of the animals the Pudwudgie could transform into, according to the Wampanoag people – not only do features of the animal show heavily on the sigil of Illvermorny, the Pocomtuc, which Martha Steward, the squib daughter of the Sayres, married into, allied themselves with exactly this tribe in the war against King Phillip
* Gormlaith had dark eyes and hair … and looking at the film adaptation, it seems these traits run in the family – perhaps even due to being related to the Pocomtuc
* She’s seen wearing, primarily, blue and grey – the colours of Ravenclaw, which Isolt felt a close connection to – and her golden pendant, like the students of Illvermorny wear a brooch
* During Gormlaiths attack, she summons the Pudwudgie William, who kills her via a poison arrow – much like Newt captures Grindelwald using the swooping evil and it’s poison – both her and Isolt then take the wand the dark magician used, but not to use it 
* One of the Boot brothers became an auror – the other one married a healer (this one’s hilarious and convinced me that Tina’s mother is from the line, there’s no reason why we learn this about their lifes)
* Twins were born, and named after their ancestors – though we don’t know his birthday, we know that they were both born in 1901 … and, oddly, share the dark hair and eyes with both Gormlaith and, likely, the Pocomtuc tribe
* Her nickname “Tina” as an Anagramm hint to “Anti (och)” works on some degree – Isolt used an Anagramm when travelling to America


**3. Parallels to Credence' story**

* He was raised by a cruel woman/relative (adopted in his case, that’s confirmed)
* She believed in a strong separation of two groups of people 
* Isolt fled from Puritans in Britain
* Anagrams: I believe his real name is Antioch (the name was hidden in both movies' titles) - and that he was named this for being the first biological magic son of this line in generations (what did the actual prophecy say?)
* Tina and Queenie certainly have a connection to the Illvermorny founders – but the triskele has three parts – like the three original brothers
* Tina and him were, canonically, born in the same year, his birthday is unknown – Martha Steward and her sister Rionach, their likely ancestors, were twins
* The power of love broke an enchantement  in the story, when the twin girls cried out for their parents and broke their sleeping spell – Credence broke loose and killed Mary Lou when Modesty was in danger, and there once was a source that the obliviation didn’t work entirely on him – he still had dreams of Tina, and somehow, her voice could calm him down (much like Aberforth could calm down Ariana)
* His connection with Nagini – not only does the ability to speak/understand Parsel in the Sayre family, strongly (though it’s not confirmed for him yet)  … her costumes are, exclusively, blue – for no appearant reason, until you consider how much it mattered to Sayre wanting to be a Ravenclaw, so much so she included the colour as the primary one in the Illvermorny uniform
* Rionach kind of sounds like an Anagram of “Antioch” (Isolt Sayre used one when travelling to America)
* In the names he’s been given so far, you’ll find all the letters for “Ignotus” and “Cadmus”, two of the Peverell brothers – in the titles of both movies, you’ll find all the letters for “Antioch”


**4. Parallels to Grindelwald** 

* Gormlaith = can also mean blue (Grindelwald’s blue fire)
* A radical ideologist (like Mary Lou was as well)
* Gormlaith tried to kill Isolt’s adoptive sons – Carrow kills a child at his orders
* He possesses a wand of immense power that only he can control – from the same family 
* He “rescues” Queenie and Credence and introduces them to his ideology, much like Gormlaith ""rescued"" Isolt and intended to abduct her daughters (and adoptive sons, she was impressed by their ability and wondering if they were pureblood)


**5. Parallels to the Elderwand**

* A powerful wand created by the eldest Peverell brother – Isolt created one as well, from the horn of a horned serpent
* The elements of both a horned serpent and a thestrale, two creatures with a bad reputation, is interesting
* Isolt also stole a powerful wand, Salazar’s, from her aunt – she eventually chose not to use it 
* If Credence is the first male wizard of the family in generations, it would make sense that they’d name him after the eldest brother, Antioch 
* Salazar’s wand was buried at Illvermorny, much like the Elderwand was buried at Hogwarts (but … is it still there?)
* A spell spoken in Parsel can stop the wand, Gormlaith ensured it … I don’t know what to do with that yet, but I feel like this is going to be important


**6. The Boot and the Goldstein family**

* In Tina and Queenie’s apartment, there’s a collection of school books on charms – written by Chadwick Boot (plus, Eulalie Hicks, who teaches this subject, is going to appear in the next movie – maybe finding the heirs to Illvermorny is precisely her part in the next movie)
* One Boot both left America at some point – Webster went to Britain/Scotland 
* The Goldstein family lives in two countries too – at this point, we have to remember that the law which forbid wizards in America to speak to muggles was established 156 years after Martha and Rionach were born – and the Boots were only a little older, so it’s possible that, aside from Rionach and maybe Isolt and James, the ensuing generations from Martha's line were alive, but banned from most of the communicating with them now – not wanting to have their children grow up in such a country, it would make sense that Martha’s descendants (non-magic) left and went to Europe – knowing people there already, descendants of their adopted family, the Boots. At this point, we must also remember that Anthony Goldstein and Terry Boot are usually mentioned together in the HP series, and, even more importantly, both are Ravenclaws, the house that meant to much so Isolt 


**7. The Lestrange family (foreshadowing)**

* Not considering female members as important enough to be included in the family tree (we only learned through Fantastic Beasts about the Sayre line) – actually an obsession with the male line so bad, Corvus III and IV married their cousins to avoid the birth of another daughter
* The raven symbol in connection to both Corvinus Gaunt and the crow Gormlaith could transform into 
* A family with cruel, strict ideals about pureblood-supremacy (and degrading women) with a member who defies both (Leta)


Last note from the person before the screen who's questioning her sanity right now ... not only would this make the story very wholesome in every way, it would also **explain why we have such a detailed history concerning the founders of Illvermorny** - and why we had it from the beginning O_O I can't see any other reason why we would get all of this info, all these parallels and it just being additional info with no impact - this is too intervined. 

Thank you very much - honestly - for reading this theory :)

I'll add more if there is

Edit: 

And there is :)

* Webster Boot married a scottish witch - in one of the songs from the sorting hat, it’s implied that each of the Hogwarts founders was from a different part of the british isles - and Rowena Ravenclaw was said to be from “glen” aka Scotland (just a side note, I like this detail - especially given that both Terry Boot and Anthony Goldstein at Hogwarts were Ravenclaws)
* the symbol of the House Lestrange is a raven - while the original one of house Ravenclaw was an eagle, the word raven remains, and often occurs in it’s latin form in Salazar’s line
* Leta’s story is one of the most present and insistent we have on a member of house Slytherin being, indisputably even, good
* if this theory is correct, then not only Isolt and her descendants, but also Tina, Queenie and Credence are, by blood, **Slytherins** (this. this absolute wholesomeness) and not only that, but descendants of the one line in his family that was non-magic **(this. this is it.)**

Edit 2:

**The Illvermorny song**

(written by JK Rowling) 

(sung by Tina and Queenie in a deleted scene)

*we draw our inspiration from good witch morrigan*

* ""Morrigan"", Isolt's nickname - inspiration also means ""breathing in"" = first breath/life 

*Wherev' we roam - our one true home - our one and own - is Illvermorny dear*

(this.)

* Queenie does the stomping for Pudwudgie (her house) /""Ca-caw"" for Thunderbird, the house founded by Chadwick Boot (their likely ancestor) the younger brother of the Boots

* Tina does the purring for Wampus - the house founded by Webster Boot, (!) the older brother of the Boots - while she's actually house Thunderbird


Edit 3:

Concerning that the Goldsteins left the country, this may be true as well for the family of **Grimmson** , the bountry hunter the ministry employs in CoG.... 

A dreaded band of bounty hunters known as *The Scourers* roamed the first societies of America, especially committing crimes on other wizards - even providing their services to Puritans who were hunting witches. Their eventual escape to muggle society also led to the founding of the *Second Salemers* - I don't have much more yet, but a bounty hunter appearing in the story and kind of working between the fronts of the ministry and Grindelwald does look like a hint

Edit 4:

Queenie's birthday, the 6th of January, is also known in to Christians - as the day of Epiphany oddly, but usually as **""Three king's day""**

Btw at this point, I have to do a rundown of the reoccurence of the number **3** in this theory

* Queenie and Isolt, as well as the founding of Illvermorny and the incidents of Paris, are *300* years apart
* Isolt's ancestors, the Peverell brothers, were three
* the brooch she inherited from her mother, a Peverell, was a golden **triskele** (this symbol also appears in the horned serpent sigil/Isolt's house and in the Ivvermorny school uniform
* between her and Cadmus, there are three family members by blood - Salazar and his daughters Gormlaith and Rionach
* Isolt had three magic children - her daughter Rionach II and her two adoptive sons, Webster and Chadwick
* Credence had two adoptive sisters (who resemble Tina and Queenie somehow a lot in looks, costume and even a little in actions) - and it is confirmed that the three were the only ones Mary Lou did adopt out of the orphans she cared for - he could have had any siblings written for this story, right?
* Tina, in the first movie, hugs both her sister and Credence (he also, for some reason, appears among her family memories in the death cell
* in the Sayre family, three women/three generations (Gormlaith, Isolt, Rionach II) could speak/understand Parsel
* there are three powerfull wands in the family - the Elderwand, Salazar's wand and Isolt's, made from the horn of the Horned Serpent

Edit 5:

Probably small, but do you remember the story of Helena Ravenclaw and the bloody baron, aka the house spirit of Slytherin? It would be kind of fitting if, at some point, people who were, by blood Slytherins, but by house/choice Ravenclaws (or both) and formed a family - though we only have two accounts of Ravenclaws (Isolt and Terry) - and we need some more good Slytherins, who knows if Webster's and Martha's branches in the following generations didn't have countless!)

Edit 6: There are more parallels between the story of Gormlaith and both movies ...

**FB1**

* Grindelwald tries to get to Credence to recruit him - Gormlaith intended to abduct both Martha and Rionach II after killing their parents. Not to mention that she killed Isolt's parents to raise her to be a pureblood-supremacist - and that she considered to abduct Chadwick and Webster too 
* Dumbledore says * ""We were closer than brothers"" * - but Grindelwald still sends an assassin after him, much like Gormlaith killed both her sister and intended to murder her niece as well) 
* she battled Chadwick and Webster Boot, not wanting to kill the first since she was impressed by his power and thought about recruiting him, depending on his blood status - together, they could almost fend her off ... and again, these two may have been related to Tina and Queenie's mother


* her attempting to kill James can be compared in a way to Grindelwald attacking Newt 
* much like Gormlaith, he followed Credence across two countries - going on three with Brazil in the next movie

**FB2**

* Gormlaith went after Isolt and, ultimately, her family ... while this is a very different story with other motives, Yusuf's story kind of goes into a direction like this when he tries to fullfill his unbrekable vow ""to live"" - almost exact opposite motives, I know, but ...  it works at least, with someone threatening both the direct target of the conflict and their offspring
* interestingly, Tina and Newt saving Yusuf and healing him could be kind of a recall to Isolt and the Pukwudgie William saving the Boot brothers ... who were also injured by a magical creature. Also, there was conflict between Isolt and William at this time. 
* Jacob, in the first movie, was also cared for by the two (primarily Newt here, but nevertheless) after getting injured - that's also, oddly, how he met Queenie/his spouse

**The Wampus Cat**

While writing this, I researched the Wampus cat - and almost fell off my chair. 

The legendary creature (which kind of resembles the Zhou-Ou and can accordingly run fast enough to avoid arrows) and is the sigil for Webster Boot's house is said to have the power of .... 

**Legilimency** 

(I'm close to making this info it's own post)

Edit 7: 

Aside from Modesty and Chastity resembling Tina and Queenie a lot, remember - Tina, when watching her happy memories of her family, firstly saw them - and then, *interestingly* , how she rescued Credence ... he was literally among the memories she had of her **family**

Edit 8:

Rionach means **""queen""**

* Rionach I = Isolt's mother
* Rionach II = Isolt's daughter
* Queenie = III

Also, Queenie was born on 6th of January - among many other things and hints, again, the ""Three King's day""

**Three Queens**

Edit 9:

There are more than a few parallels between the Scamander- and the Boot brothers - Webster was an auror, like Theseus, of course, but Chadwick resembles Newt a lot - also a world traveller, he wrote a series of books too on his subject (Charms - hey, Eulalie Hicks' subject again) which Tina and Queenie had - and he married a healer.

But most prominently: he founded **house Thunderbird**

Edit 10:

The story of Isolt Sayre included how she travelled by ship to Britain, then America, disguised as a boy and under the alias ""Elias Story"", an anagram of her name. It was a pretty significant element that I've been wondering about ... 

In this case, we would have two parallels 

* the woman we see on the ship, which I've recently theorized to be a sister of Mr. Goldstein I called Esther (who could be the source of Tina's second name - and they do look a lot alike - see  
She was titled ""Credence aunt"", and given that one way or another, she was on a mission to get him out of the country, she very likely travelled under an alias too - an anagram of her name is possible, I'm still working on re-arranging the letters of ""Esther Goldstein"" to an alias that would both function and hide her true identity enough. 

(the one who worked the best so far, in last name coverage and story relation too, was ""Edith Greenlosst"" - names usually foreshadow something in HP, and she seemed to have lost a ""green"", a member of the youngest generation in the family tree - but not only wasn't it her true name, the actual baby lived) 


* ""Elias"" as a name refers to a prophet - specifically the one who, according to Wikipedia, will announced the coming of the Messiah ... idk, I feel like Isolt having this alias and the chance of someone (presumably a son) born in their family after a prophecy/to a seldom stellar constellation works surprisingly well


*Side note:* : By now I feel like JK wrote the history of Illvermorny first, then structured Fantastic Beasts around it ...


Edit 11: 

Pointed out to me by a fellow redditor:

* moeykrimz pointed out to me that the quartett of Newt, Tina, Jacob and Queenie which forms in the first movie seems to represent one Illverrmorny house each:

Serpent: **mind, scholar** ; Tina --- Wampus: **body, warrior** ; Queenie --- Pukwudgie: **heart, healer** : Jacob (the founder James was also a no maj) --- Thunderbird: **soul, adventurer** ; Newt

(also, again: we have the Slytherin parallel in Tina, the Legilimence one for Queenie, the non-magic one for Jacob, and the parallel to Chadwick Boot, the younger of the Boot brothers who's elder was an auror)

I'd love this as foreshadowing to the role Illvermorny may play in the future, aka as kind of present from the very beginning :)

Edit 12:

fifa_1995 pointed out to me that the names ""Gaunt"" and ""Barebone"" both are english slang for a ""scrawny"" or ""haggard"" person - plus, in the Gaunt line, there's also the name ""Corvinus"" :)

Btw at this point, I wonder if there is a connection between Corvus Lestrange and the Gaunts - maybe via a mother once more! How cool would that be, and if Credence was, after all, a relative of Leta in some way :D

Sirius said it long ago, pureblood families are all related :)

Edit 13: 

This dawned on me : 

If Credence is a descendant of this family, then we'd have a pretty good message about the ""importance"" of somebody's family - because as far as I can see, while the family tree had Salazar, Gormlaith, her ensuing line, which may or may not have a line to the Letranges, and, you could say, Antioch too who desired power, it also has Isolt's line, the added one of the Boots, and the one that would ultimately lead to the Potters/James ... 

So, the family is pretty balanced on ""bad"" and ""good"" blood ... and what he makes of his life is, not just for this dynamic, completely **his choice**. 

I love that.

Edit 14: (I should probably start an own blog concerning this theory...)

**Parsel**

As mentioned before, Rionach II Steward chose not to have children, in fear of passing on the ability to speak Parsel. Yet nobody seemed to consider that *her sister* , a squib, reproducing, might pass this gene on in her place.


Credence forms a close bond with a woman whom we **know** speaks the language. 

Coincedence? 

And while there's no solid proof either that Queenie or Tina speak Parsel, there isn't really a reason to rule it out - especially for Queenie.

By the end of CoG, she is now in one place with not only Credence, but also Abernathy (whom we've seen has recieved an oddly forked tounge, implying he's been given the ability to speak the language), being the only people at Nurmengard she can form an honest bond with and who implied to switch sides one day ...

Plus, one reason why her and Tina may have kept this ability to speak/understand it **absolutely** secret is the same Ron and Hermione told Harry - it's an ability highly frowned upon and associated with dark magic by wizard society. 

This may be why Rionach refused to reproduce at all - and how absolutely *ironic* would it be if three descendants of her family at once would be born being able to understand and/or speak parsel, leaving her efforts completely in vain because, again, *noone* expected her *non-magic* sister to pass it on?

(repeating myself, but - this.)

Edit 15: (I really gotta do something with this theory to make it more structured)

**Rapport's law**

I've mentioned how the law that was established 1 1/2 centuries (which is long for us, but barely 2-3 generations living and dying alongside, even for muggles) likely banned Martha Steward's descendants from further communication with their magic family (huh, much like Tina was banned from contact to Credence ...) - and they were also faced with the chance that, if a magic child was born from the current family, it would be taken away - perhaps to their relatives, sure, but they'd still be banned from communcating with them. On this level, it would make perfect sense if Martha's descendants, or at least some of them, perhaps someone who had married into another non-magic family already (here's where the name ""Goldstein"" may have come in) decided to leave, and asked for help from the Chadwick-Boot descendants, who then made contact with the Webster-Boots in Scotland so they'd have a place to stay and some help to start over in Britain ... seems very logical. Plus, that they'd stay in contact, not only for emotional bonds.

We know that, in Britian, the laws on how much muggles with a familiar connection to a magic one are much more eased (uncle Vernon was allowed to know about their existence before Harry was even born, and nobody ever came to obliviate him and/or say something to Petunia - and Lily and James met with them, so they knew he knew too. So, the Steward-Pocomtuc-Goldsteins and the adopted Sayre-Webster-Boots staying in contact
is very likely - as is that, another few generations later, a daughter of the Boots and a son of the Goldsteins, not biologically related after all, would fall in love ...

Edit 16:

JK Rowling once confirmed that Tina and Queenie are ""distantly"" related to Harry's schoolmate Anthony Goldstein (half-blood) ... which must mean there was another man (and he was in Britian!) who passed this name on... likely an ancestor or another relative of Esther and William  ... after several generations in the 90s, that would make them the nieces/cousin's children of his ancestor, and we're at distant :) 

This, at least, gives us the confirmation that there *are* Goldsteins in Britian ours are related to :)

And then it would be hilarious once more considering that a Salazar descendant joined the DA and ultimately joined the battle against - his other direct descendant, Tom Riddle ... alongside Terry Boot, the descendant of his granddaughter's adopted children! :D

Actually, Anthony Goldstein and Terry Boot being friends ... that always felt like kind of a foreshadowing, and it makes sense if their families have been close, even related by law, for decades :)

Edit 17:

Martha Steward married *the brother of a friend* of the Pocomtuc tribe. 

(this. .. is hilarious, actually XD)

Edit 18:

Since Rionach had no children, Martha Steward's line is the *only* one that still descends directly from Salazar Slytherin ... and this line ending with a non-magic descendant marrying a magic one, creating half-bloods that are muggle on his side ... again, this is my most valid reason to believe in the theory. 

The sheer wholesome justice of Salazar's non-magic line existing and resulting (by adding magic blood from another line) in Tina, Credence and Queenie.

Edit 19: 

Grindelwald states in FB1 ""Your mother is dead."" to Credence ... and yes, while Kendra is too, we learned in the same movie, only a few scenes before, that the Goldstein parents both died of dragonpox years ago... plus, Mary Lou says that Credence mother was a ""wicked, unnatural woman"" - and while she's never met her and only has spoken Irma (and she knew she wasn't his mother, they talked), considering that, again, it would make sense if Mrs. Goldstein was the magic part of the spouses/if the father was a non-magic descendant of Slytherin, we could take this as foreshadowing .... :)


Edit 20:


Remember how Isolt Sayre travelled under an alias? When Credence was switched out with Corvus on the ship, and was then given to Mary Lou ... he literally was **travelling under an alias** .


Edit 21:

This is an update: half-blood, which both the Goldsteins in America and the one in Britain we know of are, is a pretty strechable word - it can mean anything from muggle parent/grandparent to muggle somewhere in the family. The Goldsteins in America must have been half-blood to die of dragonpox, and we have an account of an owl-breeding grandfather... but that's it. 

This would also mean that Credence isn't the first male wizard born in Isolt's family - but I don't mind, it could still be his father (sometimes, families only have daughters for a long time - it ended the Peverell name after all) or another relative. 

This leaves us, with either a muggle named Goldstein marrying a witch at some point in history (in Britain, perhaps?) or, and I want to come to this: that the exact muggle heritage is unknown, at least to Tina and Queenie. Many things can happen to a family within 267 years, especially single members *breaking* with a family entirely, moving away, and take who they were *to the grave* (intentionally or dying untimely) leaving the next generation oblivious to whom they were ... voila. I like this :)

And at this point, we have to adress the **curse** . 

The Horned Serpent, in the Illvermorny backstory, accordingly told Isolt in Parsel that, unless she accepted him as part of her family, it would be **doomed.**

And while she appearently sort of did by making the Horned Serpent her house sigil and accepting his horn as wand material - her daughter Rionach, accordingly, *massively* rejected being a Parselmouth, to the point where she refused to start a family. Maybe it was due to this being a trait of Salazar Slytherin and her insane aunt Gormlaith, especially since her switching the wand off via Parsel almost led to a disaster for the family ... she had a problem with this part of herself.

And here's the jist: there's evidence for some doom among the family in her generation. 

Martha, being non-magic, felt wrong about life among wizards and went to live with her non-magic husband at his village - their adoptive brother Webster went an ocean away to Scotland and stayed there with his local spouse, appearently not caring to see his family any longer - especially his sole biological family, Chadwick (although he was a world traveller - still, Webster moving so far away from everyone seems odd... especially since there's no real need for him to be in Britain - his parents were magic settlers from Ireland, there's no way they were the only ones - and Terry can still easily be descendant of their family there). And, while Chadwick studied Charms and wrote books for Illvermorny, there's no account of him teaching there like Rionach did. (hey, Newt also wrote books, but never taught at Hogwarts)

What I'm trying to say is: much like there was a curse of Hogwarts never being able to hold a DADA teacher longer then a year, there may be something in this case too: maybe Isolt accepted her daughter rejecting this (kind of off-putting and related to her childhood trauma and dangerous family) ability and thought only her accepting the Horned Serpent was enough. 

In conclusion, we kind of have evidence for a drift between the two sisters and the two brothers (parallel to CoG) and, looking at how Tina and Queenie's parents died and Credence suffered, the doom seems to be ongoing ... also since we have no account of what other misfortune happened among their family (although I wouldn't put past that the Scourers (killing and, hey, even *trafficking* wizards *(to Europe?)* and Rapport's law may have played a role).

Edit 22:

(adding to the idea of the curse)

While it's easy to assume that Webster and Chadwick chose love (in latter's case perhaps also world travelling) over staying near their family/at Illvermorny - isn't it kind of odd that neither of them, auror and charms expert after all, considered teaching? Sure, Chadwick dedicated himself to education via books, but ... why didn't he use the vacation times for travelling? 

Besides - is it really that easy to assume that love was their sole motivator? Because for Martha, it was also feeling terrible about not being magic - and oddly, we have no info about the brother's relationship as adults, or to their adoptive parents and sisters as they grew up ... I'd just like to keep this as a note. Even if there were no difficulties leading up to their eventual drift, they still split up in many ways ...


Edit 23:

About the Pocomtuc tribe - they, historically, along with other tribes, join the Wampanoaog Confederacy in King Philips' War, - afterwards, small bands remained in Massachusettes and many married people from other tribes, but also **settlers** (Source: Wikipedia) 

There's that :)

Edit 24:

**Eulalie Hicks** . A teacher from Illvermorny, is going to play a larger role in the next movie. 

I think I've mentioned that, as a charms teacher, she's inevitably familiar with Chadwick Boot's work, maybe even his life to a degree. Plus, Dumbledore doesn't pick his allies at random - there's something special about her we're yet to discover.

And again - Illvermorny enters the story, presently, once more, for no appearent reason ... she could have been an auror, a historian, a healer, a potion's expert, a ministry official, an author, even a fellow researcher for magical creatures, or a mysteries employee - but for some reason, ""Lally"" is required to be a teacher for this story - and not defense against the dark arts, not transfiguration - *Charms* , Chadwick's subject, who's books were present in Tina and Queenie's apartment.

Furthermore - I've discussed the endless parallels of the history of the school and it's founders, and Fantastic Beasts ... what if she picked up something similar? What if she's got more knowledge about the family, actual prophecy (not the poem) and/or the stellar constellations from Carnerius' book we know about? Of course, getting to Credence with this is difficult for several reasons, prominently since the ""good side"", from his perspective, betrayed and nearly killed him - and they may need something to make it work ...

Edit 25: 

We know since FB2 that Credence is, accordingly, (or allegedly, counting in Tina as a potential Great Avenger too) the only one strong enough to kill Dumbledore (except for Grindelwald) ... now, since Dumbledore is one of the most powerfull wizards of his time, it would take a hell of a heritage to meet him... 

Grindelwald claims it's direct, but ... if Credence is a descendant of Salazar Slytherin (one of the four greatest wizards of his time) and, by that, descendant of three equally powerfull ones, the Peverell brothers - that would equip him for this fight. 

Edit XD: Also, halfbloods have been noted to be more powerfull than pureblood wizards - so adding the lines of Steward, the non-magic Pocomtuc family and Goldstein may have given descendants of the family the last necessairy boost to reach this level 

(and so Tina - someone whom we've seen holding her ground against Grindelwald (who could have killed her, but didn't even try ... ) and even conjure a shock jinx powerfull enough to throw back Theseus Scamander))The history of Illvermorny is the key (theory)"
0,"I’m in the midst of rereading HP DH and stumbled upon this line when Harry is reading an excerpt of an interview with Rita Skeeter on her new tabloid-y Dumbledore biography. Anyone have any theories on what it could mean for the inevitable Dumbledore/Grindelwald duel? 

Rita Skeeter: ""All I’ll say is, don’t be so sure that there really was a spectacular duel of legend. After they’ve read my book, people may be forced to conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly!”

Is this a hint that maybe the duel didn’t happen as traditionally assumed? Weren’t there eye witnesses- would they have told others what happened? Is Skeeter getting down to the facts, (like she did for Harry’s exclusive interview in OOTP) or twisting the truth (like she did in TGOF and partially DH)?

I know that if there ended up not being a big duel I’d be pretty disappointed from an entertainment standpoint...but JKR has never yet let me down in terms of her subtlety of plotting. Maybe this could give us some theories about how Dumbledore ends up with the Elder Wand if Grindelwald is now possessing it. 

What do you guys/gals think??THEORY Deathly Hallows hint for Dumbledore and Grindelwald duel? What do you guys think?"

Enjoy :)


**The family tree**


* Several parts of the Peverell family tree are yet unknown – the family name became extinct through the male line, and interestingly, every time a daughter was born, it eventually led to a great wizard – Voldemort, Harry, Isolt Sayre. And we wouldn’t know about the connection if it wasn’t for the HP lore – the Lestranges, this we see, don’t mention female branches in their family tree too.


*(foreshadowing!)*


* One of Cadmus’ descendants, Martha Steward, a squib, married a non-magic man of a native American tribe (Pocomtuc). The tribe lives in Massachusetts, so not far from New York, and this was about 300 years before 1901 … it’s possible that one of their descendants married into the family of Goldstein – to eventually move to Europe too, just like, maybe even along, with the Boot family? Here we can wonder if it was due to new laws in America arising, ordering that magic and non-magic people, perhaps even family members, were no longer allowed to even speak to each other. Then it would also make sense that they married someone magic and had, eventually, Tina, Credence and Queenie


* It’s also, however, possible that the line continued via Cadmus’ brother Antioch – (funny how Tina as a name comes pretty close…). Antioch was the creator of the Elderwand, and whether he had descendants is unknown so far – but possible, since, as we’ve established, women aren’t mentioned in the family tree unless they’ve gained enough fame, like Morrigan and Isolt Sayre. Interestingly, during the finale of Fantastic Beasts 1, both Tina and Credence manage to more or less **disarm** Grindelwald, who’s now master of the wand (though he doesn’t use it here) … Credence pushes him over and he struggles to hold onto it, and when Newt captures him in the subway, Tina summons the wand as he drops it … I like this detail 


* the family tree cites the Boot family as the line of an adoptive son of the Peverells – the family had a great part in founding Illvermorny before moving back to Britain eventually – and curiously, Harry’s schoolmate, Terry Boot, is usually mentioned together with his friend *Anthony Goldstein* . We know from Rowling that this Goldstein is distantly related to the ones we meet in the movie – so it’s possible that the family had branches both in America and Britain, maybe relatives they moved to after moving to either Ireland or Britain. Then it would make sense for us to meet the sisters in America and an aunt on a ship to the country from Europe/ Britain or Ireland


* So far, we have met two descendants (well, three with Terry Boot) from the line of Peverell – interestingly, in both cases from the female one, aka from Merope Gaunt and Loanthe Peverell … so another powerful wizard is still missing, especially since the line of Isolt Sayre was added 


* Credence formed a close bond with Nagini – Salazar Slytherin was one of the first recorded Parselmouths, but it’s likely that he inherited this quality from the previous generation – so maybe Credence speaks it too, without knowing how? Plus, though unconfirmed, both Rionach Sayre and Rionach Steward, close relatives of Martha Steward, may have been Parselmouths as well – Isolt Sayre was able to understand the language (Dumbeldore understands the language too, but JK Rowling explained this along with his ability to speak, for example, meerish too, that it was simply due to him being “brilliant”, so it sounds like he learned it)


* lastly, him being a Peverell, but of the female line and half a muggle, would bring a balance to his heritage that being a Dumbledore wouldn't ... it would also work with Tina and Queenie as his strong sisters 


**Clues in the story**


* If you look at Tina, Queenie and Credence, you can definitely see some parallels to the Peverell brothers – one is powerful, one strives for love and one cheats death. But they’re different people – Tina would never brag about being powerful, Queenie has every right to question the laws that keep her from Jacob, and Credence didn’t choose to survive, and, when meeting Yusuf, was outspokenly ready to die – plus, he still doesn’t know who he is - the name of the last brother, “Ignotus” means “The unknown”. Also, let’s talk about the fairytale – it paints a picture of three brothers, but two act more similarily – Antioch and Cadmus both demand an object that gives them a power no one else has, but end up dying – Ignotus meanwhile manages to use his object differently and, in the end, agrees to death … we could roughly say that this parallels Tina and Queenie growing up together, but not wanting the same things, and that Credence just wants to hide and live 


* There’s kind of a circling of names – Antioch, Anthony, Tina, Antonio (the Chupacabra Grindelwald uses to escape, then tosses out of the window) and, as we recently got as a hint “Aurelius Antoninus”


* The Goldstein siblings being descendant of Antioch would make them the rightfull heirs to the Elderwand, and a threat to Grindelwald’s rise to power – so he got two of them onto his side, and likely planned to get to Tina too, maybe even as the first … it’s likely that he, having taken Graves’ place, even made sure she would get to see what was done to Credence to provoke her to defend him, fire her and then approach her once she was desperate enough … only he underestimated her spirit as an auror, her will and how she’d still try to watch over Credence, even at the risk of being fired. Given Grindelwald’s obsession with the Deathly Hallows, I’d even say him stealing the elderwand and two children being born from the Peverell line (and maybe below a certain constellation of stars/after a prophecy was made, RBB39 has a theory on that concerning the *Atlas of Celestial Anomalies* by M. P. N. Carnerius from TCOG) was the initial reason the Peverell-Goldsteins send their son to safety ... maybe even both children if the father/mother had other siblings beside the aunt we see in the memory, perhaps a couple even, who went to America with their daughter and then had a biological child (Queenie) - to the public then, and to Grindelwald, they could claim ""the baby"" hadn't survived


* Let’s talk about gold and stones – the Peverell brother Cadmus created a stone that would bring the dead back to life in a way – so a descendant of him, marrying someone named Goldstein, would work storywise … and it would make sense that the pendant Tina is wearing was an engagement/wedding gift for her mother originally … and here we get to the very important detail that it’s not just a gilded object – the pendant is hollow, and in Tina’s case, most likely, contains a photo of her family – literally keeping them alive as a memory (which she can show Credence one day?)

Edit: O______O

A while ago, among her hints on Twitter for FB3, JK had a star constellation of Queenie's zodiac - her birthday is on January 6th, the day of **The Feasts of Epiphany**

Why is this important?
An character and historical figure in the story of Hannukah is the emperor **Antiochus Ephiphanius** - and we know that, the Goldstein sisters are, indeed, jewish. 

Queenie - Epiphany - Antioch

Edit 2: probably the most imporant question: 

Can we be sure that the Peverell brothers and/or the Deathly Hallows will play a role for this story?

Rephrased: In a story about **Grindelwald** , that, actually along with the first movie, gave us **almost unnecessairly detailed** information about the Illvermorny founders, their family and their familiar relation to the brothers ... much more info than we have on any other wizarding school, almost more than Hogwarts - can we argue that they already play a huge role?

No way. We were supposed to notice. The whole extended explanation of the beginnings of Illvermorny had this one purpose for the story.

Edit 3: 

Why does the name Antioch seem to matter so much to the story if we're talking about the Cadmus line?

If we look at the line, we see that, from Rionachs line, only girls were born - **so far** . 

(btw you should really read the story of the founding of Illvermorny - the story of the Boots alone carries several elements directly from the story and theories we've had so far). 

If, by marriage with a witch, from the muggle line of the Peverells, a wizard **son** was born ...  there's a chance he was the first in generations, and most likely named after the brother first born, Antioch. Besides, we know that the name ""Anthony"" would later be used in a branch of the Goldstein family, and spellwise, it's not that far from ""Rionach"", the name of both Martha Stewards grandmother and her own **twin sister** . 

Btw, I just noticed that Martha was the only known No-Maj born to the family ... so how awesome would it be if Tina, Credence and Queenie were her descendants?Perhaps a Peverell? (theory)"

0,"Throughout the movies, the costume design of the characters shows interesting matches in the colours of the costumes ...

Let's start with the people kind of inbetween the sides: 

Both Queenie and Abernathy go through the same costume phasis - from pink, to red/auburn (in her case, elements of red in her dress too, in his case, his ties) and then, as they’ve fully joined Grindelwald, black and white.

It’s interesting, because we see something like this for Credence too: especially the black and white wardrobe he wears at first is interesting, because at this time, he’s still under the control of someone who leads an agressive and excluding cause too (parallels between Grindelwald and Mary Lou are certainly there, especially in the last scene when he literally stands in a room with an alike architecture to Second Salemer’s orphanage (mostly the railing behing them).
image

You could argue that, when they were wearing pink, their life was alright (especially since this works with Credence - his life never was alright) - the auburn could symbolize vulnerability (and where it ultimately leads them) and the black and white adapting to a cause that stands for a crass separation/radical ideas.

Interstingly, we see Abernathy on both the posters and in his last scenes (after he picks up the Lestrange family tree (!)  in a coat that is, remotely, blue - a colour we mostly on people actively fighting, firmly on some level of good side or with potential to join it - again, I believe dark blue coats are going to become this sides’ signature team costume.

There’s more: 

* Queenie is wearing red shoes, which are often used in movies as a symbol of a woman growing up.
* In the first movie, she’s also wearing a deep blue dress, while otherwise, pink is her signature colour
* Grindelwald himself is wearing dark blue - the colour has a calming effect, and it could be a calculated element to present himself as a hero/friend to his followers - plus, his blue is going rather into the direction of teal &gt;&gt;
* among Grindelwald’s followers, we see some dark green - interestingly, this could work as a contrast/other end of the scale to the characters wearing red and auburn initially/still may turn around


On the other side, we have a use of blue: Newt, Tina, Yusuf and Nagini (especially her, since it makes a good contrast with Credence' auburn red) have been seen in some shade of blue throughout the series - and by the end, they have formed a group.


Just think it's interesting :) plus, Leta is kind of making an exception by wearing purple/magenta, though I'm still wondering what this could mean for her story from here...

Edit: Actually, I think I found it - the colour she's wearing, this purple, may refer to both pink/red, again, as a symbol of vulnerability, but also holds blue, the colour firmly associated with the good side/the blue group we see by the end of the movie - I think that's her :)

He goes  out, jumps on a bicycle, magically accelerates it and heads towards Siegessäule where the German ministry of magic is situated underneath. Everyone is gathering to elect the new Minister of magic. A young man takes a seat. The candidates are about to present themselves. Grindelwald steps forward and makes a speech about the revolution, shares his vision about a war and following prosperous future, manipulating people into thinking that's what the war would bring as a result. Grindelwald sits down,  noone seems to have courage to compete with him. A man with a beard and a hat in the first row, seemingly a ministry guard looks a bit sceptical but keeps silence. The question asked again, who else wants to be a candidate. The young man stands up, takes a position in the centre of the arena and presents himself as (Henrik) Gregorovitch. The question from the audience ""Gregorovitch? The son of a Wands maker? Have you even graduated from Durmstrang?"" Henrik:""The last year."" Everybody laughs, Grindelwald looks curious. Gregorovitch gives a speech about hate Grindelwald is spreading, how he lies and manipulated people, and mentions the famous opposition leaders magically disappeared days before the election. Says that the theft of the wand from his father is the least crime he ever commited. Grindelwald says there is no proof. The voting starts. Almost everyone votes in favour of Grindelwald. He gives a final speech and those who didn't vote for him start being arrested. Gregorovitch is approached by a ministry guard from the first row, with a beard and a hat, he grabs Henrik. Grindelwald says that Henrik will change his mind. Or die. The guard says that apparently Grindelwald will regret it, reveals himself for a moment as Dumbledore, shows Grindelwald thé Blood Pact, a moment before a Phoenix appears to teleport Dumbledore and young Gregorovitch away. We see Grindelwald  seemingly shocked for the first time, but he quickly looks confident again. The arrests are taking place all over the ministry and the flags are changing into those with a deathly hallows symbol. The camera flies out of the ministry into the night over Berlin and we get the title and FB intro music. Then we see Newt and Jacob in Brazil.What an opening scene in FB3 could be like"

A while ago, we got a statement from Ezra Miller concerning his character in FB, ~~rather that he had info Grindelwald had told the truth by the end of CoG - not the whole story,m though~~ As someone who has been finding and collecting evidence for his identity as a Goldstein, this of course struck me a little – especially since JK Rowling had stated that “whatever you think you know by the end of the movie might not be the case.”


So… except for this, appearently?


I have exactly two problems with the statement (the second one may end up an entire essay XD) but first, let’s talk about the simple rules of filmmaking/story publishing.


**1.**


For CoG, everyone was very tight-lipped about the actual plot, and information about the progress was and still is delivered only in pieces to the actors. By the end of the movie, we’re left on a cliffhanger, a statement by Grindelwald – after we’ve learned about the blood oath, Dumbledore sending Newt into the fight too, Credence being strong enough to do the job as well and, most importantly, Grindelwald being a skilled liar and manipulator – so much so that the MACUSA had to remove his tongue to stop him while in prison. You could even throw in another statement by JK, that he had planned to use Credence/whoever the Obscurial might be against Dumbledore in the first movie already (oh hey … he didn’t know it wasn’t Modesty … so how did he find out this boy was a Dumbledore?)
So, the ending leaves it open, rather tending to an obvious lie, whether he’s telling the truth. We’re kind of foreshadowed that the next movie will be about everyone finding out whether it was true. 

But we seem to be wrong? In fact, they seem to not see the truth of the matter as a plot point that should stay open, that should only be revealed during the progress of the story – and that just baffles my mind. This information is simply a massive spoiler for FB3, and I don’t understand why they just throw it out like it doesn’t matter. 
Shouldn’t that be part of the narrative we get to see as a whole? Don’t they kind of spoil that along? 


It doesn't make sense.


Are they lying to us like Grindelwald would, (or, in an Infinity War kind of way, to the actors too) putting us in front of someone who we're sure has all the answers and disregarding hints to something else going on? (I'm beginning to start butthurt again XD)

Edit: Also imporant considering this: Ezra Miller isn't new the movie business/to keeping secrets - especially given, again, how the majority of the plot for Crimes of Grindelwald was not being allowed to be disclosed already - so, usually, he would have taken this secret to the grave if necessairy. It's part of the job to never disclose anything that you haven't been permitted to. And this is info that, I think, he never would have disclosed voluntairly - and hell, it wasn't a slip-out - so why did JK, appearently, even *order* him, to ""reveal"" this?

The only vague explanation I have is a sloppy ""it matters who he is as a person"" - and even then, again, why didn't we get this as a plot twist to a narrative? And why in such a blatant way? If they had foreshadowed something akin to ""you might not expect"", that would have been perfectly acceptable and leave us on the brink wanting more. 

And hell - they said they couldn't tell us **Newt's patronus** because it would be a huge spoiler - and the theory we have here has no significant spoiler potential - it's likely a thunderbird, like both Frank and Tina's Illvermorny house, and it's likely (not confirmed) that it's her patronus too, symbolizing how they belong togehter and will stay together - but we know that! How does this need to stay secret, but the info about Credene not? 

Anyway, that’s just my first problem. The second is how this revelation crashes into more than one existing story structure. In fact, it crashes into almost every character’s story we know from around this time.


**2**


Let’s start with Percival, the Dumbledore sibling’s father. I’ve talked at length about how Percival Dumbledore was sent to and died in Azkaban post his daughter getting attacked by three muggles. This was when she was six years old – and long before he could have fathered a fourth child born in 1901. Even if JK changed his timeline as well – the story remains that he was in prison, before Ariana could even think about attending Hogwarts, and died there. The fact that Kendra was, until 1899, alone with taking care of her children, is important a the chain of events we’ll discuss in a moment. Besides, it is highly unlikely that they conceived a child in prison – Azkaban inmates aren’t allowed to have visitors unless they have a high enough ministry position (such as Barty Crouch), and even if they had managed a union, if discovered, she would have been punished as well, leaving her children, most prominently Ariana, to their own merits – besides, why would they want a fourth child when there was no way they could properly be there for it? The pregnancy alone while caring for an Obscurial could lead to no good end. And when was it supposed to have been born, if Percival was the father? Assuming that they somehow managed to, again, trick the guards magically (unlikely as Percival spend years in prison and, as we know, by starving prisoners of emotion, they also starve them of most of their power. So, suffice to say there is no logical way in which Percival Dumbledore can be Credence’ father. 


But what if Kendra had an affair?


While this would be okay, it’s still unlikely that she risked a pregnancy while caring for Ariana – besides, Aberforth explained how she “wasn’t young” anymore when she died, so having a child at all may have been difficult – and let’s not forget that she, accordingly, died in 1899 – early, as there still had to be space for Albus to meet Grindelwald and for Ariana to die in summer – before the school year started that is, as the fight we know about between her brothers and Grindelwald erupted before Aberforth was to return to school. While we’re at this year – Grindelwald is using a skull to enhance his visions, with the inscription of 1898. Meaning the person it belonged to died in the year before he met Dumbledore, which is also likely to be the one in which he was expelled from Durmstrang. My skull, now, is cracking – because it put’s this person’s death firmly into the original timeline!


Going back to Kendra, her death was tragic, but vastly important to the original chain of events – 

* Ariana becomes an Obscurial due to a traumatic attack by three muggles
* Percival is sent to Azkaban for attacking them right after and can’t take care of her 
* Kendra is left alone with this responsibility until 1899
* she dies, leaving Albus and Aberforth to care for her 
* Albus is frustrated by this, and additionally compelled to get away when he meets someone matching his intellect 
* when the fight between the three men erupts, it’s also because Aberforth wants to stay with Ariana to care for her, and they get into a fight about the future 


Kendra dying was an important plot point that led to this fight … and moving her death further down the line doesn’t really work. 

While we’re talking about Ariana, I’ve crossed off already that her sheer condition made it irresponsible to have another child. I’ve seen people wondering a few times if Credence could be her son, but unfortunately, I cannot stand for that. Ariana, even if they made her older (16/17), all the way until her death, was, accordingly, severely mentally ill – there is no way she could have conceived a child that isn’t disturbing, too disturbing for this story. 
Besides, Ariana died, we heard in from Aberforth – her funeral happened, there was a body, and Obscurials do die from their parasite usually – there was even a fight between him and his brother on this day, which happened before witnesses and is recorded… besides, even if Ariana somehow had survived, would she really have kept Aberforth in this belief? And Albus? This, for me, is the biggest hint, besides the existence of her dead body for her being firmly so … she loved at least Aberforth dearly, and wouldn’t have let him suffer. 


Speaking of Aberforth – if there really was a child, and even if Grindelwald thought he could be The Great Avenger (despite him then being half-muggleborn) … why would he let Albus send the child away? Wouldn’t it be the safest from him in his company? Perhaps even at Hogwarts, if he started teaching quickly? Another breach in the timeline – when Grindelwald left the Dumbledores and all except two were dead, he must have known there was a child … so sending it away with a non-magic relative would actually put him into more danger than he would have been in with Dumbledore. Besides, the phoenix chick at the circus – Grindelwald and Dumbledore claimed a phoenix would come to a Dumbledore once – yet we know latter had Fawkes, and anyone could have sold the chick we see (not confirmed to be Fawkes, too) to the circus. And Credence becoming attached to it could simply relate to his conclusion from FB1.


Now that we’ve covered that, let’s talk about Dumbledore. (yes that one XD)


We’ve covered the timeline and the necessary chain of events, but what I really want to talk about at this point is how him having a positive family relation kind of torpedes his story arc.
The view we get of Dumbledore’s life in HP7 – the death of his parents and his sister, his breach with Aberforth, his loneliness that only someone challenging his intellect (aka Grindelwald) could really console, is very tragic – but I love it.


It paints a picture of a man who had everything wizards (actually, humans) strive for – power, intelligence, charm, perceptiveness, respect from everyone … he could have become minister of magic several times. But none of it made him happy. In fact, being so far above everyone else left him completely alone , never to be really understood or challenged by other people – until meeting Grindelwald.


I like the idea that the Dumbledore we know had nothing else in his life but helping others (not always correctly, sure), being a teacher and a friend to people who were alone to a degree, too. It became even more present when he became the first headmaster to be buried at the school grounds – Hogwarts was the most important part of his life. Certainly the one that made him the happiest. 


The idea that he had any sort of life outside the school, the order of the phoenix and old friends, aka a younger brother (he never mentioned, neither did anyone else for some reason) whom he had a positive bond with, kind of destroys this concept. I know it sounds like I’m not granting him a bit more happiness, but – that’s what the original story was. Dumbledore was one of the greatest wizards of his time, but as we learned in HP6 and HP7, some aspects of his life would always be filled with emptiness, regret and pain. 


But if they want to play, let’s play. Let’s say we do get all those timeline breaches (btw, you might say that McGonnagall was one, but her being older didn’t harm the original story – this would, massively).


I don’t think Credence is going to really **become** Dumbledore’s brother. 


In my mind, they do meet, it’s all discussed, fine, but Credence doesn’t become part of his life – at his own wishes. 


His reasoning being that he’s spent his life mostly around people whom didn’t know him or were far away – and Albus always will be, due to his job. Besides, there is no family to return to but him and Aberforth, and he never was part of theirs. 


Besides, Dumbledore said ""true brother or sister"" - why are we supposed to believe it's going to be him? I don't care about blood, the group has done a lot more to earn this place in his life.


So he agrees to a friendship, but changes his name and decides to start a life with the group – going back to the only joy he has known, alias people who actually have all the time, attention and knowledge of him to become his family. I’d like this conclusion. Nagini saying “He knows what you were born, not who you are.” could then be considered a foreshadowing of this decision/the only one we have for this conclusion :/ .


Honestly, we got no hints to him being a Dumbledore :/ being an Obscurial is circumstantial, so doesn’t count, and neither does the phoenix, which easily could have been brought into the circus on purpose by Grindelwald. While we’re at it … Grindelwald went to NY to find a possible Obscurial to fight Dumbledore post a vision he had about one, but had no clue it was Credence until the end of the movie – and then, miraculously, it’s none other than Dumbledores’ own brother?

Next, Newt is dragged off to gaol, interrogated and sentenced to immediate death. What does the Ambassador do to protect his countryman? Nothing. Not one thing.

0,"Protagonist = main character in a story. And the story of the first Fantastic Beasts happens through the eyes of Jacob Kowalski. This story is *his encounter* with magic. The inciting incident is *his encounter* with Newt Scamander. That is the stepping-off point. 


Jacob desires a bakery (beginning). He is thwarted, to the extreme (middle). He opens a bakery *and wins the girl (end). The final shot of the movie is Jacob in the bakery, having won the delectable Queenie, and enjoying the realisation of *how*. He wins. 


Newt carries sub-plots. His motive is getting Frank, the Thunderbird, to Arizona. But he is sidetracked by his empathy: for Jacob, Tina and Credence. He cannot stand by and witness horror passively. But his story ends when the bird is released. He says goodbye to the girl, chastely. Jacob closes the movie. 


Newt is wonderful. But Newt is in the role of Dumbledore (the Dumbledore of the Harry Potter stories). He has the answers. He has secrets. He is not honest until honesty is forced out of him. He does not act until pushed to action. Principally, he *cares*. He cares for the creatures in his suitcase. He cares for what Tyrion Lannister* would call “cripples, bastards and broken things”. But his own development plays second fiddle. 


For his ending, Newt releases a big bird into the wild. Not the proper wild, mind. Some 2000 miles short of where it’s supposed to be. The win with Grindelwald is a bonus, but it’s not what Newt specifically cares about. He cares about the creatures. And, in terms of creatures, Newt’s progress is mild. Only in terms of friends has Newt’s life altered, and not yet significantly


Jacob, on the other hand, kicks down doors, punches out the evil goblin and tackles the erumpent head-on. His instincts are good and true. Yes, the final fireworks are Newt’s terrain but Jacob still rushes into battle. He does not let Muggle inferiority hold him back. He follows the fragrant Queenie into danger. In fact, Jacob safeguards the suitcase: wherein you *find the fantastic beasts*. Cos Jacob is the most important character he holds the title object in his hands. 


The arc is all Jacob’s. He gains friends during the middle-act rumpus who help him achieve his goal... which is pastries. Having become the man he wanted to be, Jacob is open to receive the scrumptious Queenie. 


He wins. He is the stealth protagonist. 


(Another example of stealth protagonist would be the robot played by Alicia Vikander in the movie Ex Machina. The story follows Domnhall Gleeson’s character, but all the important beats happen to her.)

(besides, note how he's still looking for his mother in CoG even when he was told she had died ... I like that detail, he wants to know the truth himself :) Ravenclaw I'd say :)


2. The existence of the blood oath makes it clearer than ever that Grindelwald can and will say anything to send him into the fight against Dumbledore (props to Johnny Depps acting during the last scene btw here, there's no menacing joy about this decision ... just the realiziation that he's sending an assassin on his way)


3. This comes from the JK herself - she recently posted, concering FB3, the picture of a book about a roman emperor and philosopher - I looked up this ones exact name to be Marcus **Aurelius Antonius** - (practically Anthony Goldstein XD) 


4. Grindelwald tells him ""As much as your brother has celebrated your torment, he wishes to destroy you."" - I believe, in a way, this may be a twist of words pointing to Tina ... she was the only one who fought against his torment at the hands of Mary Lou, watched over him afterwards, didn't want the MACUSA to kill him ... and she's still on her mission to keep him safe, to help him survive, (true brother or sister, hey :)) more than anyone. Plus, all throughout her life, she had to be strong, both as an older sibling and as someone who build an own life (not to mention that there doesn't seem to be an abundance of female aurors in the 1920s) - and the series likes to flip stereotypes, so yeah - Tina did everything a man of her time would too. 


5. **The wand** Grindelwald hands him looks a lot like Tina's (this has been pointed out to me on Tumblr) ... same length, colour - a little bulkier, (less formed as he doesn't know who he is yet). Interestingly, neither is hers... almost as if part of her identity is still missing ... plus, usually, as we know **""The wand chooses the wizard.""** - so getting the right one for him would have been very difficult, even for Grindelwald ... **unless** he found out what kind of wand chose his twin. He's been to America, out and about too, could directly acess Tina's file/own wand permission papers whenever he liked (or have Abernathy make a copy) - hell, her wand was in his office and he fought it personally with *Graves' one* before! All of this easily may have led him to find out most of what he needed to know to have one crafted for her twin (funny how it all happens on screen technically XD) Who knows, maybe he's even recruited Gregorowitsch to craft it 

Thank you very much for reading :)

Edit: something just dawned ... if his real name is Anthony/Anton/Antonin etc. ... the easiest shortening would be **Tony** ...  the twins Tony and Tina.

It sounds so bonkers yet so much like something JKR would pull .... XDDD

Edit 2: forgot to mention: unless there has been some *serious tampering* with the timeline of Percival and Kendra Dumbledore's death aka imprisonment until death, they *can't* have concieved a child born in 1901 ... the Goldstein spouses did.5 more hints to Credence = Goldstein (theory)"
0,How many of you Agree with this guy's Opinion?
0,"FB3:

Battle between Albus and Credence in Berlin, in which Fawkes will help Albus not Credence and Credence will learn that he isn't Aurelius. Albus will approach Credence like Newt did in the New York Subway and he will tell him that his sister, Ariana, was also an Obscurial. And Blood Pact... Maybe to destroy the pendant, the blood of people related to those who sealed the Blood Pact is required, i.e. Aberforth (Albus) and Bathilda Bagshot (Grindelwald). So want to see a scene when Albus is trying to reconcile with Aberforth at Hog's Head in Hogsmeade, and where furious Aberforth would argue that it was Albus' fault, that Ariana died, and that Albus was a fool by making the Blood Pact with Grindelwald. Dumbledore later apparates at Godric's Hollow. Bathilda then meets Albus at the Godric's Hollow Cemetery at Kendra's and Ariana's grave. In Bathilda's house, the historian will give her blood to Albus, saying that no matter who Grindelwald became, he was a charming boy in his youth, which Dumbledore would agree.

Later films:

Grindelwald was hunting the Deathly Hallows, even though he didn't need the other two, except the Elder Wand. Somewhere there was a mention that Tom Riddle would appear in the last movies (I'm betting 4 or 5), so there will also be Hagrid and the Chamber of Secrets action. Armando Dippet will call the Magical Law Enforcement Department workers, including Travers and Theseus. The Killing Curse and poison will be ruled out by them. Dumbledore will summon Newt, who will examine the student's body and find that there are no signs of the beast bite. Riddle will then bring Hagrid to Headmaster's office, where Hagrid will be forced to confess that he have Aragog. Newt will express his shock as to why the 13-year-old got an acromantula, but will deny that Aragog killed the girl. Dippet has to make a decision and he expells Hagrid (he reminds Cornelius Fudge here, who didn't believe Harry and Dumbledore), so Travers breaks Hagrid's wand. Dumbledore is watching Riddle closely, because he knows that was Riddle who opened the Chamber of Secrets, because Riddle told him in the Wool's Orphanage that he is Parselmouth, and Dumbledore knew that Voldemort was related to the Gaunts. Dumbledore vouches for Hagrid, and allows the broken pieces of wand to be kept, and Hagrid becomes the gamekeeper's assistant. Later Riddle with Nagini will travel to Little Hangleton, where he stunned his uncle, Morfin Gaunt, and stole his wand and Resurrection Stone. He went to Riddle House, where after strange conversation he killed his father and grandparents. Riddle returns to implant a false memory on Morfin, then flees the village before the Magical Law Enforcement Department officials show up. They check the last spell casted by Morfin's wand and arrest Morfin, who confesses, that he killed Muggles. Dumbledore, hearing what happened in Voldemort's family hometown, heads to Azkaban and retrieves a memory of the visit from Morfin, but it is too late to show it to the Ministry as Morfin died.

Grindelwald might get a vision in which he sees Voldemort sending Basilisk on Martha Warren and Voldemort creating a Horcrux from Diary. He also saw a vision Riddle murdering his father and grandparents in Little Hangleton and making a second Horcrux from the Resurrection Stone. There was also mention of Fleamont Potter in FB1, so maybe Grindelwald will also find out that Potter has the Invisibility Cloak. And of course, before Fawkes will help Dumbledore in Berlin, Grindelwald will get from phoenix two feathers for two powerful wands (Tom Riddle's and Harry Potter's). Grindelwald will give them to Garrick Ollivander, or send one of the acolytes to deliver them.

And people who will die: Eulalie Hicks, Yusuf Kama, Theseus Scamander, Credence Barebone, Abernathy, Vinda Rosier, Gunnar Grimmson.

Newt will marry Tina (they had grandson Rolf, which married Luna Lovegood) and Jacob will marry Queenie (they had descendant during 2014 Quidditch World Cup - Quentin Kowalski).

This is how I see it.

0,"Harry Potter to me does a very good job on having a playful, a lot of the time lighthearted, and fun magical story turn serious or dark without it feeling like drastic tone shifts.

Fantastic Beast and Where To Find them does more of the fun, and at moments teases hidden darkness within, where as Crimes of Grindelwald arguably... has issues with what it wants to be. ( I like the movie don't hate me )

Where I'm going with this is; should Fantastic Beast have the same tone as Harry Potter? Lighthearted fun balanced with brutal darkness? Or should the franchise thread more on the serious side, judging on the circumstances of WWII and Credence... 

I remember reading here on this subreddit some sources of Yates or Fogler switching between saying that FB3 will be ""more brutal"" and ""more light"" which is confusing because of the contradictions but I think what they're trying to say is that they're finding a balance now. Thoughts? What do you want?Darkness, playfulness, or balance?"

In general, I don't want them to stray too much from The Crimes of Grindelwald. I hope it's going to stay interesting and intriguing.

0,"Here's the painting: 

This post is kind of related (XD) to my previous one about the skull Grindelwald uses

For some context: Cassandra is a notable figure in greek mythology, and while there are differing versions of her story, the basis is that she was gifted by Apollo to make prophecies and have visions, but cursed to never be believed. She also appears in the Aenied II - while this story holds *many* elements from the Illiad, I want to note it here still because of it's relation to Rome (in this case just to Italy though).

Having visions that no one believes sounds like something Grindelwald would say about himself - and we know JK Rowling has used greek and roman mythology/names before ... what really drew my eye here was *the date* of the painting.

**1898** - the same we see on the skull Grindelwald uses to enhance/visualize his visions. Furthermore, this painting is currently in London at the De Morgan centre, so there's a chance that Rowling has seen it. And the leaves/twigs we saw on it, I've checked, look a lot like depictions of natural *laurel wreaths* - Cassandra in the painting is wearing a golden one (one variation of a laurel wreath crown at least). 

Plus, while the substance he smokes from the skull could be a reference to the one usually referenced concerning the *Oracle of Delphi* , it could, perhaps at the same time, refer to fire/Apollo (god of, among other subjects, the sun) - this could also be an explanation for the golden ring around Grindelwald's iris, as a subtle reference or a hint at how a seer's powers express themselves sometimes. I wouldn't put it past that strong seers often develop this and it used to be, in Greece, considered to be a mark of Apollo.

My prediction now is that Grindelwald's mother was a seer (her name likely being Cassandra) that she was italian (don't worry, I'm not disregarding actual history - it's just in relation to the shared history of Italy and Austria) and passed her abilities on to him, likely even became his mentor on how to use them.

Edit: Forgot to mention, there are **two snakes** at the golden part of her dress, much like the two Grindelwald used to escape in TCOG

Edit 2: FB4 was once said to take place in Italy ... and if Grindelwald's mother was from there ... could it be that the fourth movie will, much like HP6, be about exploring his past to try and find something to defeat him?Cassandra (1898) (thoughts/theory)"

0,"(title “Beinhaus skull” not canon)

Here's the link to a picture for a collection of skulls that seem to have inspired the one Grindelwald used in TCOG (didn't want to use the picture directly as it's kind of unsettling (yet kind of facinating)



In the picture, you see a collection of skulls from a *Beinhaus* in Austria (fun fact yes, *Bein* or *Gebein* is an older german word for bone/s - nowadays, ""Bein"" only means leg)

In some alpine regions there, the skulls (and skeletons) were retrieved from cementaries, and brought to the Beinhaus, to be kept there and inscribed with the name and the date/year of death of the buried. According to the report below, this was done to make space at a cementary, and as a tradition to still show respect for the deceased, perform a second funeral and preserve the identity of the buried.

Now to the theory :)

Interestingly, we can also see the symbol he uses for his flag on top of the skull he uses. According to the article, some of the skulls at the Beinhaus held the initials of the deceased - to some degree, this may be the case here too.

What we know for sure is that: 

* this person died in **1898**
* Grindelwald was born in **1882/3** - making him **16/17** when they died. Around this time, he was also expelled from Durmstrang.

(we’ll get to another significant date following sonly in a moment)

Yet I don’t believe this skull to be a student’s - among the information we have about being banned from Durmstrang, there’s no indicator to a murder/accidental death. Meanwhile, in the case of Newt’s explulsion, a student almost dying was noted specifically. 

I’d rather this is the skull of either a family member, perhaps even another seer and/or someone who instructed him how to use his abilities. But there’s no name on it - only the words “For the greater good” in german. This, now, is a strong indicator for why this person died. The words sound a lot like a sacrifice, perhaps even a voluntairy one.

There’s two posibilites now:

1. Grindelwald didn't know and/or murdered the person the skull belonged to in cold blood - if this was his first murder at all is unknown, but given the words, it's possible that, to some degree, he didn’t feel for it much, rather accepted it as a necessairy act to get ahead concerning the Greater Good

2. (I think this is rather the case) The person he killed ordered him to - there’s a chance it was indeed a close family member or someone else he had a bond with, in both cases likely another seer, who fuelled, or maybe even introduced him to the ideas he then began to extend. 

Plus, while it’s also possible that said person committed suicide, I think it’s more likely that they specifically ordered Grindelwald to kill them, as a twisted way to teach him to let go of human relations, even close ones, to suceed as a leader for their cause. It's possible also that he intentionally didn't inscribe their name on it, either to hide his capability for murder from his yet uncertain followers - or out of grief. 

This theory would also give a whole new meaning to the existence of the **blood pact** .


* Ariana Dumbledore died in **1899** (roughly a year after this person)

* Grindelwald and Dumbledoore knew each other for much less, so he definitly killed this person before - but he still  accepted, likely even initiated the pact 

And this would work, even fit very well with his actions during Fantastic Beasts so far: he requires Dumbledore’s death, “For the Greater Good” - but he either initially didn’t want it, or always wanted someone else to do it. If he had always more or less planned to get rid of him, he wouldn’t have agreed to the blood pact - from what we see, it seems that he even suggested it. He’s still very willing to make sacrifices For the Greater Good, but he welcomed avoiding to kill Dumbledore himself. 

Meaning to some degree, this one human relationship is still in the way of his plans - and the person who died likely didn’t intend this, or would have suggested a blood pact to him. 

So, what do you think? I feel like there’s still more to discover here - please let me know, I’m as fuelled as this skull right now XD

Thank you very much for reading ^^

Edit: update on the proper line of events : 

* 1898 - this person dies (before/after Grindelwald is expelled from Durmstrang)
* 1899 - Kendra Dumbledore dies, leaving her son Albus in sole charge of his siblings and stuck at home
* 1899 (still) - Grindelwald moves into the neighborhood to live with his aunt and they meet (don't know each other for long, but find a connection and an equal in the other) - the renowned fight happens, Ariana diesThe Beinhaus skull and its' role in Grindelwald's story (theory)"

0,"I've been searching around for people's theories and takes on who Credence is. This one by far is the one that intrigued me the most. It may start to sound ludicrous or unlikely but hear me out.. It's JK Rowling. She manages to make the most bizarre concepts canon from time to time. 

Back to the theory, I want to try and expand on it with my own thoughts, offering room for discussion and explaining it in the most of my abilities. This theory involves a lot of insight about obscurials, unsurprisingly, and I like to think I am mostly educated in the lore about them and how they work, but I could be wrong so please don't be mean or defensive and correct me! It would make for a more interesting discussion.

Now to the theory. 

Aurelius is the son of Albus Dumbledore. No, he did not affair with a woman, we know he's gay. And although for the time period lots of gay men have gotten with women to hide their identity, usually its for them to settle and we know Dumbledore has zero desire to settle. He is not the type of man to seek a woman to hide himself. It would be irresponsible and very unnecessary. Don't forget out of character. He already is hiding in Hogwarts, and Jude Law also stated Dumbledore closed his heart after The Summer of 1899. He has not loved any man since Grindelwald and the scene from CoG with The Mirror of Erised confirms it's because the feelings are still there.

Alright, so we got that out of the way, you must be confused. How did he have a child without someone to bare it? Here's where shit gets crazy.

The night Ariana had died, her obscurus was loose. In amidst the chaos of the event, the dark force was able to retract the blood kept in the pact necklace, using the DNA to create life; a baby.  This makes a lot of sense and here's why:

\-  If we are going with Credence is actually /related/ to Dumbledore, this theory makes too much sense. Ariana's abilities are very similar to credence's and there is a small chance Credence could have just been similar to her without having anything directly to do with her. These movies described his sickness similar to Ariana's for a reason. JK is making conscious decisions and we all know she dislikes coincidences. 

\- The fandom thinks Credence is Ariana reincarnated which.. cannot work. Obscurials are people that are possessed, to put it simply. Obscurus do not take form unless it has human essence to attach to. If the blood of the pact was present, it may have resorted to taking it.

\-  By taking the blood and creating a human form, the obscurus is living itself. Not making Credence an obscurial. He IS the dark force in human form. The obscurus had moved from Ariana and desperately tried to make a body of its own. This explains why Credence has been shown to be indestructible. Ariana was able to die because she's human with the parasite in her. Credence is not human. Obscurus cannot be destroyed, just the host.

\- The timeline matches up ALMOST perfectly, Credence is hinted at being born AROUND 1901. Not long after The Summer of 1899. The woman on the ship who lost ""Corvus"" could have been a lady in Godric's Hollow who has a doorstep Dumbledore had left Aurelius on.

\- The blood pact was very much present during this event.

\- Dumbledore cares a lot about Credence, you can see bits of it when he tries to encourage Newt to find him. 

\- Grindelwald also cares a lot about Credence and treats him like a parental figure. Calling him 'My Boy' and enabling him as if he were his own.

\- There's no way Credence could be a nephew or a brother. Timelines and family trees do not add up at all and it's hard to believe Aberforth has something to do with it.

\- Again, JK Rowling has bizarre ideas. If you put this through a 'Harry Potter' lens and think back on all the crazy revelations in CoG alone, there is not an impossibility of this being canon.

And now to the thing we're all thinking. Yes, Credence is not only Dumbledore's son, but also Grindewalds. He's their blood child  I assume the name is probably something Grindelwald gave him, probably for personal reasons.

I genuinely love this theory and think it's the most dramatic one out there, story wise. Also the most shocking. And it fixes all the holes in the ""Credence is reincarnated Ariana"" theory too because again, an obscurus cannot make a body without having the resources to make one.

It would be cool if this were the case. Aurelius having to chose between two biological parents... Dumbledore desperately trying to drive a son into a good path because of guilt of how he treated his own siblings. Grindelwald turning Aurelius against his father. There's potential.

Okay, rambling done! Tell me what you think! Do you agree or disagree? Tell me why! Is there faults to this theory? Tell me about it! Would you like to see this become canon? I want to know!

0,"Hi there :)

This is a short take on how the next movie could conclude (concerning Grindelwald’s possible plans) and work with the (possible) next two time jumps throughout the series - enjoy :)



**1. Rio**

I believe that, by the end of Fantastic Beasts 3, Credence sets himself loose from Grindelwald - whether or not this is connected to him finding out about his true identity (Golden one yes, Dumbeldore my … behind :/) or siding with the others for bonding reasons outside of that is yet to see.

Either way, I believe it leads to Grindelwald admitting defeat - and removing his Obscurus.

He’s a man all about being prepared for the unexpected (especially post Paris - and anyway, Credence standing up to him wouldn’t exactly be) so either

* he had his followers steal info concerning Newt’s travels, and tracked down the village in Sudan where he tried to help the other mentioned Obscurial, retrieving information from witnesses about how he did it

* he secretly began experiment with Obscurials himself (either abducting ones who had already developed the parasite or, worse, even had his followers condition one or two regular wizard children (orphans, for example) to develop it - we’ll come back to what a “sucess” could lead to in this case.

Either way, he could, in both cases, drop a comment about how it was Newt who gave him the idea on how to do it (perhaps because magical creatures are involved?) - leaving latter absolutely devastated.
image

Anyway, it’s not the end - through the true grief of everyone around, and the fact that they all would have been there for him as siblings if given the chance - his parasite is replaced and he comes back to live (death-fakeout, I know, but in this story, it works really well) - he joins the other side, still very powerfull, and most likely goes into hiding with the help of Dumbledore and the order.


**2. The following time**

Afterwards, nothing is heard of Grindelwald for a year. Then another one. Ultimately, ten years pass without a direct word from him.

It’s said that there are still scarse meetings of his followers with acolytes, and, most importantly, many people remember his ideas, but nothing else happens.

Except for his vision presented in Paris to come true.

The worlds are being faced with another world war, which reaches levels of destruction and death neither has ever seen before. And now more than ever, the wizarding communties are questioning if complete secrecy and not using their powers to help is the right thing.

Meanwhile, the group (which I hope is going to be called the Thunderbird ring) had children, and still do their best to work against his acolytes and everything Dumbledore can detect - but Grindelwald has massively upped his caution and own secrecy, so there’s rarely anything to find. It’s said he’s at Numengard castle, but even former followers of him don’t know how to get there, and the ancient magic protecting it is too strong, even for the law enforcement in Austria. Of course, at the same time, they enter the battle fields to free muggles. Their children (several of which there are now) and the non-duellists meanwhile stay in houses thoroughly protected by aurors and magic - the minstry agrees to this as there’s still a chance followers of Grindelwald may target them.
image

However, that doesn’t mean they take his threat very serious after such a long time of nothing happening - I see a similar story as in HP5 arriving, concerning that, even though there’s no actual proof the danger is banned, they’re determined to keep up the impression of it. Perhaps even beginning to discredit people whom they used to work with who argue that he’s going to come back …

In addition, they could also tend to disregard it for not direct unwillingness, but being very occupied trying to keep the current unrest among the wizard societies concerning the war under control. From what we’ve seen about Travers, this could be something he’d do.

Anyway, the movie could end, for example in 1942, with Grindelwald’s sudden return - to a wizarding world more open to his ideas than ever - and a new weapon.
image


**3. Unexpected**

I believe that, in the 10 years leading up to the events of the fourth movie, Grindelwald has secretly been raising a group of Obscurials - conditoning them to surpress their magic, then to release it - several times the living weapon he used to oversee. He would have to keep them seperate from each other, of course, so no close bonds can form between them. Credence lived past the age of ten and the creation of his parasite due to forming bonds with his adoptive sisters most likely, but since it wasn’t removed, he couldn’t be healed. He could have one or two together then, especially when it comes to enhancing their lifespan.

And they wouldn’t find help yet by the end of the fourth movie - I believe by the end of FB4, Grindelwald does manage to take over, at least in several countries - sending close followers and wizards to take over the ministries and each have one or two well-trained Obscurial on their side to destroy any resistances.

Which would mean that the Thunderbird ring and their children would have to go into hiding - at least for the next two years. Barely enough time to try and make their own plans to stop him.

Theory: the next movie, Newt and Tina are for some reason not on good terms after possibly a first dating attempt failed or disagreements over the law (rather) came in between, so she upped (and left).

Both him and his brother feel lonely and lost, but are told that they shouldn’t hang onto what could have been, and move on, because it’s over ...

0,"I need to list this to get a better view:

- three years ago, before the filming of TCOG even began, the case of Depp vs. Heard began ... he made his case to Warner, presented evidence, his perspective, everything. And even though the public was yet to get all the information, they accepted it - he filmed a movie that was, to a great part, about his character

- now, where he has started filming and everything would be in place so FB3 could take off in 2021 and everyone involved could work without any issues and get paid, they fire him

- not because he lost against Heard (he didn't, after all - and the press and the public now have the information concerning her) but against The Sun ... a tabloid that everyone knows the reputation/credibility of, let's be real. And not even concerning that they're going to keep portraying him a certain way (again, it's The Sun, nobody cares!) but that back then, they weren't legally in the wrong for doing so (debatable) - in summary, The Sun is allowed to post assumptions based on scarse information ( :/ ) - if they will continue to do so concerning Depp while the remaining press now works with the actual ongoings of the case isn't likely to happen

- also: Warner's decision was made, tell me if it's not suspicious, right during the **presidental election 2020** , within a week! ...... and the second corona lockdown, circumstances that we couldn't even really imagine back in 2018 ... and which, curiously, occupied most of the world's attention then.

Call me a Schwurbler (conspiracy mythist) but it feels like Warner's attitude of ""the evidence doesn't matter"" may not be as new as we think - they may have wanted to get rid of him right then, but decided to pretend to as many people involved as possible, to wait for the ""right moment"" ... regardless of the outcome of his case. And they keep pushing it, even when they can't, in any way' try to justify it to the public any longer. 

It's just tragic. Please tell me if there's any logical explanation left for this.someone help we with the logic of Warner"
0,"Should they never mention the fact that Grindelwald is suddenly played by a different actor or would it be better if there was some in-universe explanation like Grindy's FB2 appearance being just another ""mask"" he used like in FB1 with Graves or maybe him being a metamorphmagus like Tonks? What do you think they will and should do?

Personally, I hope they reimagine the character and completely change how he looks because it wouldn't feel right to just bring another actor in and make him look and act like Johnny Depp (and I never really liked Grindelwald's appearance in FB2 tbh).How would you prefer fB3 handles the grindelwald actor change?"

0,"My Abernathy+Bunty = Septimus Weasley, founding on the yet unrevealed branches of the family tree prior to him, recently got a little brittly when I remembered JK stating that Ginny was the first girl within the Weasley family in seven generations. 

But either JK ditched this idea again (very possible, and she hasn’t stated if she has further plans for Ginny’s story so far) or ... Bunty isn’t a Weasley **by blood** .

Think about it: Ginny was in the seventh generation in which no girls had been born in the family ... which puts her father and grandfather into 5 and 6 (aka perhaps the *seventh* child born to the Corvus-Lestranges technically). 

This would mean that the family, having a different view than the Lestranges surely, perhaps took some action in generation four already to bring daughters into the family ... 

... by literally bringing a daughter into the family.

Family histories are linear in the rarest cases, so for her, it may have been a little more complicated than a simple case of a couple marrying and having children.

For example:

1. Her father, (adoptive/step), a Weasley, either got divorced or was widowed, and then remarried a woman who already had a daughter - both for love and the chance that she would have another daughter. Not impossible either that he was only married once, and the family decided to simply adopt a girl to try and make a change in having too many sons. 

2. One of her parents, or perhaps even both, died when she was young - either due to an illness, an accident (magical creatures?) or a job accident? 

Or both! Given that she works as a medical assistant, I wouldn’t put past that they were healers at St. Mungos and died due to an infection or injury by a patient? Both work in relation to magical creatures as well. 

Afterwards, it’s possible that there were no other relatives around to care for her - or she really didn’t want to live with whoever it was, so, for example over a friend, she was adopted by the Weasleys? 

While we’re at it - if she’s Newt’s age and they were school friends too, perhaps they made this possible with the help of Theseus? Even being just a ministry starter, I’m sure he could find out who they should talk to in this situation. 

Plus, furthering this theory - knowing the Weasleys, is there any way someone couldn’t be welcomed  as part of the family, even 2 generations ago?

I’m in for her being a Weasley.Is Bunty a Weasley? (theory)"

Plus the last time she gave another writer to write canon, Cursed Child happened. Do you really think she’s about to give up her story rights to someone after THAT disaster?

“I don’t like how Dumbledore and Grindelwald aren’t together” in canon, they loved each other when they were younger. Stop complaining over something when at this point in time, they literally hate each other.

“I never wanted Dumbledore or Grindelwald. I thought I was getting Newt Scamander finding Fantastic Beasts throughout the world” then why on earth would JKR make 5 films for Wizarding pokemon.

0,"Hi there :)

In FB2, we’ve shared a few scenes with the head of the department for Magical Law Enforcement, Torquil Travers. 

While he is both a possible relative/ancestor to a death eater as well as another example for how the world isn’t split into good people and them, I think, looking closely, you can’t deny which side he is fighting for ... and it took me until now to realize what he’s actually been doing. 

~~In this essay I will~~  Let’s go over the scenes he appears in and their messages

Enjoy :)


**1. Newt’s hearing** 

Though the first time we meet him he appears anything but sympathetic, we have to consider a few points: this is the fifth time Newt has applied for a lift on his travelling ban - yet Travis agreed to hearing him once more. Of course, to make a proposition to him - this is the first time where we see him, despite of what we learn of his usual way of keeping order, owning up to the fact that personell of the law can’t win this war alone. Of course, the meeting probably happened at the suggestion of the other officials and Theseus, but agreeing to it still gives us a first hint at that he’s not unwilling to work with others and give them something in return. Though he prefers to be in power and to work with people who don’t threaten or defy his authority (we’ll get to that) he will do what is necessairy regardless.

When Grimmson shows up, he noticably doesn’t turn around to him, along with Guzman and Spielman ... when he takes a seat before them and accepts the job, all of them look very uncomfortable to employ a bounty hunter. I do believe there may be more reasons, maybe even slight fear of his abilites, but right now, they have to deal with the fact that they’re paying Grimmson to kill someone, and it visually doesn’t feel right to them. 



**2. Hogwarts 1**

Travers makes an entrance to Dumbledore’s lesson, smugly commanding the students to leave. We see him enjoying his authority, but the ensuing conversation with Dumbledore speaks of somehting more. 

We learn that he’s known for harsh politics, and keeps people Dumbledore’s in contact with surveilled. Through this, we certainly get a picture of a man who’s undeniably paranoid of people and situations out of his immediate control, but also that, so far, making a case for his authority has worked for him - but this war is fought by making alliances, and Grindelwald is winning, so he asks Dumbledore for help, much as he hates to. He, once more, does what he needs to do. 

And moreso, he gets noticably frustrated when he refuses. To him, the only person who could, on his own, stop the oncoming war he has been working against for way over a year now, is refusing - for personal reasons. Such even relating to a deep connection to the man he’s fighting. 

So, surveillance it is. Putting this man under his control it is. Honestly, I’d be mad too. This isn’t about agreeing with Travers’ ways, the ministry, etc. We learn eventually it’s about the blood oath and naturally Dumbledore didn’t want to admit this to a man who didn’t trust him already (not to mention that, except for a memory, which we know can be tampered with, there was no evidence for the existence of the oath) - but for Travers, there was no explanation and no possible other reaction. 

Shortly after, he calls Theseus away from him - because he knows him. He’s going to side with people over layed out order, and was once a student of this man. 


**3. The french ministry**

We only get a few lines from him here mid-walking, but the message is clear: Dumbledore refused to help them, and they’re out of options, so he returns to his original course - harshness. Arrest everyone. Kill. Theseus tries to discourage this, and openly disregards orders later on at the cementary. Here we get to another point, and the significant difference between them - Travers wants to win this war with people, but he doesn’t see them as more than tools to an end. But when an attack does happen from their side, it leads to destruction - and great loss for his department.


**4. Hogwarts 2**

When they get to the school (not the ministry, though he could have ordered it), he mutely complies to stay behind, even to have Dumbledore’s shackles removed. To me, this is probably one of the greatest moments for Travers as a character. He listens to Theseus, doesn’t hold back Newt or anyone on the bridge, and agrees to trust Dumbledore as a means to an end. Perhaps it is because the situation has turned out to be more dire than even he could imagine, and has gotten infinitely worse due to Credence joining Grindelwald - but I believe that, much as he disagrees with most people on the bridge personally, he’s still going to do what is necessairy to stop Grindelwald. And he can adapt.

So yeah, another character one has to watch several times to understand. I like it :) He’s not a good person by any means, but seems to be an alliance that will keep working against Grindelwald.

Anyway, what do you think? Did I miss anything?

Thank you very much for reading :)In defense of Torquil Travers (thoughts)"

Just finished watching the two FB films released thus far. While I can’t say I loved them, they were entertaining. I think the main issue I am having with this series so far is direction.

0,"Maybe I’ve missed this in the discussion but honestly, Jude and Johnny have and awful chemistry together. 

Here’s what I’m hoping for: in a misguided attempt to re-win back the lgbt community, JK and co will give us the steamy “I loved you!!” homoerotic wizard duels we’e all been waiting for. It doesn’t excuse her words and actions but at least she’s finally potentially giving us canonical support for Albus being gay.  

Now, Depp is an incredible actor, (and he’s said his characters are “all gay” in an interview— but this is a whole other discussion about the issue with gay characters having to “prove” their homosexuality in almost all representations of gay characters in popular culture and it loops back to JK saying Albus is gay with no textual support) but I really, really never get queer vibes from any of his characters. They are flamboyant and fantastical and over the top and high camp but still don’t read explicitly gay for me. 

All this being said: we have an opportunity to (kind of) tell a gay love story as one of the main plot points in a major, global motion picture that isn’t a “love Simon” that everyone loves because a hot, straight twink decides to show “how brave he is” by playing gay.

SO: why not a queer actor playing a queer character? Given we have like three options here I would love a new face but Hollywood demands celebrity. 

Luke Evans

Lee Pace (though Americans can’t play British except for John Lithgow in The Crown)

Wentworth Miller

These aren’t great options but they are butch enough to appeal to mass audiences and a blonde transformation for any of them would be a fun media buzz. 

Can anyone think of someone else? I’ve been worried this whole time about having to watch Jude and Johnny muddle through an intimate scene together and I know I’m the minority here but I never liked Depp in the role to begin with (this IS NOT a comment saying I agree that he should have been fired)

In closing, Rowling is still a terf which really, really sucks.

UPDATE: I didn’t want this to be a discussion about straights playing gay/representation/etc. there’s some pretty homophobic people in the comments (I see the downvotes too) but for real, I was just wondering if anyone knew of any cool queer actors that could replace Johnny. That’s it.A Gay/Queer actor for Depp’s replacement?"
0,"Hi there :)

I’ve been theorizing already about Yusuf moving to London and becoming close friends with the group, plus starting to work as and auror and joining the hunt for Grindelwald.
But I think I finally came across a very important role he may play as a reasearcher of family trees in the next movie ... 

Enjoy :)


**Tales from the crypt**

The most about Yusuf’s history and his motivations we learn at the Lestrange crypt - but in this scene, we also get the only solid evidence about Credence’ origin.

We now know for sure that:

* he was born in europe
* he was born around 1901
* (from IMDb) the woman with him was his aunt
* he was given to Mary Lou Barebone in Corvus’ place

But at the same time, Yusuf learns, through Leta, that he is not the man he’s after ... and there’s several witnesses to this testimony. So, the next step for him, especially if he starts working with Tina and Dumbledore, would be to start research on who Credence actually is. 


**New plans**


I believe, once starting his research, he’ll start with the aforementioned aunt and research shipwreck files from 1901. The Lestrange party likely was on board under the same names, or at least ones known to the family in Britain for the case that someone goes missing on sea - but I’m pretty sure aunt wasn’t. 

So, he’s probably going to take the following steps:


* find out the right shipwreck from 1901 (again: this was 25 years ago, it’ll take some time to find it) - including which harbour the Lestrange party ported from and which port they were going to, and which other harbours the ship went to along the way
* find the passenger list 
* find out the cabin Leta, Irma and Corvus were in, find that the other baby was across the hallway (this one’s easy) and research who was with him
* probably find a name - which seems like a track first, but (likely) turns out to be an empty alias 
* research staff of the ship or other passengers who survived and can remember the woman 
* eventually manage to get a phantom picture/memory from one of them, much like Dumbledore got one from Hoakey and Morfin 
* try to find her picture in archives/talk to ministry officials in other european countries the ship ported in

So, yes. That’s a whole lot of work, which he probably only can do aside his job as, likely, an auror and member of the hunt for Grindelwald. Not impossible that after the next time jump, he’s still talking to people who may know something about her. 

(she looked a lot like Tina in the flashback we saw, but that just one the side)

I wouldn’t even put past that he, unluckily, comes across a secret follower of Grindelwald who sets him up with a false memory of her supposedly being a Dumbledore. 

And this may not be the only thing in his way - perhaps some of the followers even get orders to, despite Credence being unlikely to believe him or anyone from their side, to try and take him out before he can make a discovery which is dangerous to their cause. Although, considering his current work with the ministry, this would be dangerous on itself - it could set the entire hunt and the circle of friends around him by this time up against them, and/or onto what he was researching.

I don’t know yet how he’s going to come across the final conclusion - I believe the tracks have been covered up very well, but that he will have collected almost all evidence until Rio. Perhaps he’s found which country she’s from, perhaps even a first name she gave someone, some details on what she talked about with strangers ... 

And then, ( *we dive into headcanons now, buckle up* ) in my mind, he comes across Queenie...

... who recognizes the woman he’s been thinking about for the last few years - as a relative of her parents, a sister, whom they never spoke to her and Tina about ... but she kept seeing a scene in their minds of a woman, including one of her saying goodbye to them and porting a ship with a baby, which she assumed was a cousin of theirs who died along. Only she was very little when she saw all of this, and couldn’t properly understand or remember what was said before she left. And shortly after, her parents died and she didn’t pay much more attention to the memory of this woman, whom she knew was dead as well anyway - until seeing Yusuf’s memories, she had practically forgotten her face. 

This could be her epiphany JK has foreshadowed, the final almost coincedental puzzle piece Yusuf requires to complete the picture, the answer to Credence’ identity. And it would be a great moment of teamwork for the aspiring group, maybe even one that begins to bring them all together to reveal Credence’ true identity to him. 

How the rest of his identity is going to surface I’m still working on, but so far, I’m convinced Yusuf is going to continue to find out some way too.

Anyway, what do you think? Could this be Yusuf’s role in the next movie, kind if foreshadowed by his arc in the second one?

In Watchmen he even had a hint of a German accent which would fit well with Grindelwald's Durmstrang / European roots. His voice is charming, methodical, persuasive, intelligent, and has  that seductive Grindelwald style we have seen so far. As well he can turn angry and forceful like Grindelwald does at times and also brings the cold calculating master manipulator we need in the role. 

I also feel like he is a face that will not distract from the character. He has great acting chops.

He is close enough in age to Jude Law to be on the other side. 

I think he is the perfect fit, give this scene a go and I think it will translate very well to GG.

0,"Grindelwald's Carriage Escape
It's clear the opening scenes, during Grindelwald's escape-viewed by viewers as too complicated. Why would the villain return to the scene of the crime?
BUT LET ME EXPLAIN—
There were actually several reasons Grindelwald had to return to the Thestral-pulled carriage. 
1—the most obvious, was that he returned to retrieve the Blood Pact pendant.
2—Grindelwald wanted to recruit Spielman to his cause and GAVE him a choice to join the Greater Good but Spielman refused. Spielman is from Germany, FB3 has been confirmed to be set in Berlin, Germany. Will Spielman return in FB3. Why would Grindelwald let Spielman escape? Will we have any International Confederation of Wizards in Berlin, where Spielman is the Head of Incarceration. Grindelwald was going to use SPIELMAN in the task of incarcerating muggles. 
3—OG Grindelwald was testing Abernathy's loyalty to the cause, the truth seems to rise when one's life is at peril. He seeks loyalty. Abernathy passed Grindelwald's loyalty test. 

And of course, being Grindelwald, it's safe to assume he wanted to show off his power with the Elder Wand.

Also—Tina should've been part of the security broom riders escorting Grindelwald in the carriage. That would've solidified her stance as a Dark Arts fighting Auror.GRINDELWALD's CARRIAGE ESCAPE"

But it seems people give up because Grindelwald is getting recasted. That's it? That's what's making you hate on Fantastic Beasts? Don't get me wrong, I absolutely hate what Warner Bros did to him, and hopefully with the backlash this big they can reconsider. But we can't give up on the series as a whole. It has so much potential, so much more to it. Three more movies to let it really work out but people just want to hate on it now because Grindelwald won't look the same way. Please, I love Fantastic Beasts. It would break my heart for the series to end. I'd rather have something than nothing. Yes, I'd rather have things go back the way they used to be, I really do. But if that can't happen, we can't stop caring anymore. If you watch the movies just for one person AND ONLY THAT PERSON, then maybe you didn't care about the movies to begin with. Harry potter fans and loyal Fantastic Beasts stans, stay with me please. Have a good day  :)

Edit: I'm reading all of your comments and I appreciate the discussion. I don't want to make anyone think the wrong thing, I really do believe that Heard should be fired. This was the worst case scenario. If you're gonna fire Depp, fire Heard too. If you're gonna keep heard, keep Depp too. Heard stayed, and Depp left. I would really like for it to be the other way around. My main point is that in the best way possible, we should support the series, this wonderful addition to the Wizarding World, and go against the Warner Bros. I love Fantastic Beasts, it's a very beautiful concept. I'm just really afraid that people refusing to watch the series anymore will just end Fantastic Beasts right on the spot. And that is the last thing I want. I want all five movies out to really show the entire story. Maybe rewatching the entire series as a binge would make people enjoy The Crimes of Grindelwald more, as it is a bridge story. My main point is, how unfair Warner Bros is acting right now, I want fans to keep Fantastic Beasts alive, we never seen anything else like it.I don't like how people are quitting the franchise because of Johnny Depp"

0,"I feel for Johnny but WB might not have had a choice in making this decision. Not only did Johnny lose his libel claim against The Sun over an article calling him a ""wife beater"", the Judge ruled that the claim was ""substantially true"" which would be devastating for anyone socially and legally.

Now I know some fans are angry with this verdict and may think it's quite unfair however, a major studio like WB might not be able to justify keeping an actor, who has been declared a 'wife beater' by a judge in a court of law, in one of their biggest franchises.

So unfortunately, in his effort to achieve potential legal justice, Johnny might have sadly sealed his fate in the Fantastic Beasts movies. 

I'm just curious as to who Yates and the Producers choose to replace him and which actor will be willing to take the part on. I don't envy whoever they are, that's for sure. Good luck to all of them and all the best to Johnny as well. :)Why WB might have felt they had no choice but to recast Grindelwald"
0,"So they forced Johnny Depp out off the movies, that was the end of my relationship with Warner bros and fantastic beasts. I’ve been a potterhead for a long time and will always be, but fantastic beasts are now done in my eyes. It’s sad to see the world turn in a guy that’s been trough so much and see that “woman” get away with ruining him. 
Amber Turd abused him, taunted him with the fact that no one would believe him and still gets to keep her role in aquaman without any precautions. There’s at least 500 000 people not going to watch the movie and I’m certainly one of them.

I’m also one of the people not watching fantastic beasts or any other warner bros production again. And I mean not watching, not just not paying to see. This was the straw that broke the camels back in 2020! I’m from now on pretending grindelwalds story ended in movie 2. Dumbledore took a trip to his house and killed credence (not a fan of Ezra Miller but that’s another story) and then took the wand from grindelwald before he sent him to Azkaban.

This is a sad day for justice! The verdict was a travesty, but ok could handle that if JD still would fight “her” in the upcoming case. This is the shittiest thing they could do, they stuck by him for 3-4 years even queen JK Rowling had his back. What if she refused to write the next ones since her grindelwald is gone? I know wishful thinking, but I do think we’ve seen the end of wizarding world extension at least in that brand. 
Warner bros could have been the ones to have backbone and stand for what is right and don’t bend the knee, but then again they are weak. They would have gotten the support of fans for standing up to false lies and fans would have paid to support the movies and franchise if they did.
The thought of a man like Johnny Depp loosing it all when he had the fame, the money and the support that he did, makes me afraid for the regular man in the street and his ability to protect himself from disgusting lies like that. What could my brother or father do against false allegations like that, when the likes of JD didn’t stand a chance? Nope this is a sad and scary day. 

Sending my love and support to MY Grindelwald and tonight I’ll have a glass of wine in farewell to what could have been an amazing franchise. And a little goodbye to Hollywood and their demise for turning on a actor, a true and good actor and human being like Johnny Depp.That’s it I’m out."
0,"I have a 1000 things on my mind and I have a platform. Some of my opinions might be conflicting. Please tell me which you agree with and which one you don't and why not?


**FANTASTIC BEAST**

*STORY*

This is the most conflicting opinion of mine I guess. I liked FB2 better than FB1. It introduced intresting characters with perfect fitting cast, was more grand, more magical, more immersive and my personal favourite - darker. FB1 had a better story no doubt, mainly because it ended satisfactorily. FB2 was a part of a bigger story, having no story of its own. People didn't like this concept, much to my dismay, I think it was a nice change and made me more excited for the next one.

*CAST* 

I can't convey how much I liked the cast using the words I know. Eddie, Ezra and Colin Farrel were excellent in FB1( favourite being Dan). And I liked Alison and Katherine even better in FB2. Callum and Zoe and Claudia were cherry on top. And what can I even say about Johnny. Always been a fan and will remain to be so. His resignation broke my heart. I think there should be a voting of some kind :(

**JK ROWLING**

*HER OPINIONS*

I am so upset that it turned out for her like this. There is no excuse for her... uhh...*eccentric* opinion but I hope that people do not judge the movie based on that( which I think people already have). I live in a country where such news take time to reach audience. So when I entered the theatre I had no idea of her homophobic ideology. And I loved the movie. After her saying the things she said, people have started to say that they don't like the movie( which they might have if not the grudge for her).

*FUTURE*

As I said, I hope people do not judge the upcoming movies fueled by the hatred for her. I personally think JK has never been a very good writter, but the magical world she has created, the story, and the character have easily compensated for the lack of her not very good writting. She might not be best at expanding the world she has created, but afterall it's her world, which we are fortunate to have been shared with us. She is best at creating world and I believe that upcoming movies will be great.

**CRITICS**

*HYPOCRISY* 

Some people have stated that JK sometimes introduces a new fact about the wizarding world which is completely out of context and states that it was always meant to be so. Eg: Dumbledore being gay. To be honest when I first came to knew about that I was pretty annoyed too, but now I can't imagine Dumbledore not being gay. I know a person who said to me(after learning of Depp's resignation) that JK will bring back Colin Farrell and state that she always meant to do so( Implying that she always does this) but I can't think of one instance when she did so. If you guys do please comment(genuinely curious).

*STORY*

Again, people are saying that they don't like the story, and as I have mentioned, the best thing I liked about the books as well as movies *is* the story. Yes FB2 messed up about the whole \*not being an independent movie of its own\* but I liked everything else about it.

*CAST* 

Most upsetting of all is that people actually didn't like Depp's performance as Grindelwald as much as I did. Yes I did like Colin's version but Depp is who made me much more excited. People are stating that Depp's performance is not menacing enough, but Grindelwald isn't suppose to be like Voldemort. He isn't scary looking, like Voldemort was in later years. He is suppose to be like the Tom Riddle. He is suppose to be charming, manipulative and ambitious.


**TRENDING**

*AMBER HEARD VS JOHNNY DEPP*

Now I think Amber Heard is clearly the abuser. Amber Heard's girlfriend filed a case against her for abuse. Elon musk broke up with Amber Heard because Amber Heard *allegedly* filmed them having sex without consent, and I think everybody has already heard the call recording between Amber and johnny. Plus Amber faked abuse marks which has already been proven in court. Johnny's ex wifes and girlfriends have also come to his defence. All this clearly states that all Amber Heard is doing is taking advantage of being a women.

*JOHNNY DEPP RESIGNATION*

This news ruined my morning. People might not like him, but I think that he was absolutely perfect for the role of Grindelwald. Yes Colin Farrell might work, maybe better than Depp according to some people, but it would completely alter the story and people already don't like it much(which I already discussed). Furthermore the reason Warner Bros asked him to resign is because of the allegations against him, that might affect the movie. Meanwhile Amber Heard still has the role in Aquaman 2 by *Warner Bros*.


That's all I had to say. Please comment which part do you not agree with and why?What do you guys think??!"

0,"Firstly i want to address that I’ve been thinking about this JD situation. And I feel sorry for the guy. Truly, his career might essentially be over. 

But we have to stop the mourning and look forward. We all love the Wizarding World and we want it to succeed as we want more stories and we love the HP films and books deeply. 

*WHAT WE KNOW*

But what will happen now? Factually we know they’re making the third one and presumably 4 and 5. Jude Law, Eddie, Jakob etc are returning as predicted. JD is the only one that’s not. 

*MY IDEA AND PREDICTIONS*

Or they completely go into a different direction. Completely erasing Crimes of Grindelwald off the canon while keeping Where to Find Them as canon and built the next films after that.

So to get a clear imagine of what I’m addressing and the future of the franchise in my opinion. 

So they’re keeping FBAWTFT and making it as a stand alone movie. 

And after Where to Find Them. Newt and Jakob disconnects themselves from all the wars and political drama. Travels to the Amazon and hunts Beasts for the rest of their lives. A bit like Indiana Jones style of series. While Grindelwald and Dumbledore remains in Europe trying to stop eachover. So ultimately this is the future forward.

0,"First of all, I'm really gutted hearing Depp departing the FB franchise and as much I dislike recasting, there's no other option than to move forward with a recast as Grindelwald is a key character in the series.

Seeing Antony Starr's performance as Homelander in the Boys show how he can be both terrifying, charming and manipulative that's got the same energy as Depp. When I see Starr's Homelander, he can lure you into believing he sympathizes with you and can flicker, turn against you a second later.

0,"So i was digging deep into FB and HP world again and one thing is not clear still to this day. Google says that Credence was 18 yrs old in 1926 so he was born in 1908. He is stated to be the brother of Albus. Therefore Credence's parents must be Percival or Kendra Dumbledore or else they won't be related. Here come the problems tho. According to google and forums Percival Dumbledora was sent to the Azkaban in 1890/1891 and died there later on. Kendra Dumbledore died in 1899 due to her daughter. Ariana Dumbledore died in 1899 too. For people saying that Credence can be Ariana's son: That way he cannot be Albus's brother he would be his nephew. Furthermore Ariana was 14yrs old when she died so it is not seemingly possible to give birth at the age of 14 and due to the circumstances (her obscurus) AND the biggest fact that Credence was born around 1908 and Ariana died in 1899 so it doesnot add up at all. By the year 1908 Kendra and Percival should be dead by almost 10 years. There are two things in conclusion. Some mighty, powerful magic was used here OR just simply Grindelwald is lying.  
There's some shit around FB since the Crimes of Grindelwald was released. For example Minerva Mcgonogal was born in 1935 so she cannot be a teacher of Hogwarts in 1927, neither 1910. But that's another story.

0,"Hi there :)

I’ve been theorizing for a while how Eulalie Hicks, who made a smaller appearance in the last movie and is said to have a larger role in the next movie, could be introduced to the story. Usually it was about attending school and/or university with Tina and Queenie (perhaps the one in Salem mentioned in HP4) or even being a former Hogwarts student.

Until I researched her name, and an entirely new story opened up. 




**Remember the name**

Her name (and we know JK picks none at random) likely refers to the **Saint Eulalia of Merida** , a martyr who protested against pagan gods.

But rather specifically, the story states that her captors tried to torture her with fire and to burn her - but she seemed to be **immune to fire** .

Sounds a lot like what we’ve been theorizing about Leta, aka that the fire did not kill her/just send her to another place, where’s she’d be held captive. Or that she escaped. 

But that’s just one person and another person’s name so far. There’s more.




**Shared history at Illvermorny?**


We know that Leta was send to America with her brother when she was four - the next time we saw her, she was 16 and, curiously, at Hogwarts. 

But for how long was she there? I always assumed it wasn’t for long, but now I think it was - because, why did her family want her to come back, when, according to the school bully, they didn’t even want her home over the holidays? From what the girl we hear talking about her says, it does sound like she hasn’t been at Hogwarts for long, and it would further why she became friends with Newt only then. 

In my mind, Corvus decided to let her be raised abroad until she’d be old enough to become “of use” to the family - I believe he ordered her return when she was 15 or 16, so they could start to introduce her to possible pureblood suitors and arrange a marriage deemed practical once she had turned 17.

However, I’m convinced she moved out and broke off the contact to her family as soon as she could. They likely underrestimated both her will and her magic ability (maybe she even creatively sabotaged every time they tried to engage her XD I’d love that!)

Anyway, long before all of this, I believe, she befriended Eulalie at Illvermorny - let’s be real, if she’s going to be part of the Fantastic Beasts pantheon, and already is of Dumbledore’s network, chances are high she is the kind of person that would be a friend to her. 

Plus, she teaches Charms - we know that Leta is highly intelligent and loved to experiment, and this seems like a subject that offers a lot of room for new inventions - perhaps they experimented together? Maybe the spell she puts on the school bully is even something they came up with :)

And being a skilled magic researcher and inventor could also be what made Dumbledore interested in Eulalie as an order member, right?

It’s possible that, included, they came up with a sort of immunity to magic fire ... I’m more and more convinced relating to Lally’s name, and I do believe it may come up in the next movie. 

Plus, coming back to their friendship - I believe they stayed in contact via letters and there was even an invitation Lally recieved to her wedding. In this case, she may even make her first appearance at Leta’s funeral and meet the other characters there. It would be a good way to introduce her to the story and have this character be tied into the one of the others already. Adding someone new important in the third installment of a series would be easier if there was already a connection. 




**The Hide question**


Last but not least, why Leta would go into hiding - (perhaps even with Lally’s help?)

1. She knew, revealing herself to be alive, Grindelwald would try and get to/kill her once more

and/or

2. Perhaps the spell didn’t work entirely as intended, due to her previous heavy emotional shock influencing her magic and/or due to the power of Grindelwald’s - it’s possible that she now has surficial burns across her body - having been stared at and talked about all her life, I don’t think she’d like to have the situation worsened. And we know how she saw herself even when she was unharmed on the outside ... 

I think she wants Theseus, despite loving him, to be with someone who is ""whole"" and healthy on the inside and not scarred on the outside - this could even be a plot point in FB4, where he too got visible scars along the way and insists that she’s still beautiful, and that he loves every single bit of who she is - and that, considering the guilt he feels for all the people he couldn’t save in WWI and his job, he would never want someone who can’t understand this feeling. 

Maybe even that nothing’s changed, as far as he’s concerned - they just started to carry their inner scars to the outside. Perhaps that this is even better than to hold them inside all the time. 

(btw, *side note theory* : Theseus getting scarred by Credence may have been foreshadowed in FB1 already, when he tore apart the poster of Henry Shaw - if we continue the metaphore that inner scars eventually surface, we could say that Henry’s attitude and pressure both did and killed him - Theseus is different, however. They may look alike (shaw literally means peel), but I believe that what will surface for Theseus metaphorically is the guilt and doubt he has in himself after having failed to save so many people - literal scars to his face, which he then learns to live with. And inner scars could also relate very well to Credence’ obscurus.

In relation to Leta’s scars - perhaps we won’t spend the entire movie with Eulalie Hicks ;) at least I hope there’s going to be a polyjuice side-story where they switch places once in a while so she can spend time with Newt and Theseus without them knowing. 

Anyway, what do you think? Does all of this line up? 

Please tell me if I missed something

0,It seems like the FB3 production will continue and go on as usual!
0,"As I see timeline and plot in the movies:

* **FB3 - 1930, then skip to 1937**:

*The movie is to be more focused on Dumbledore:*

Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts in the DADA classroom visits the Pensieve to see the battle between him, Aberforth Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald in Godric's Hollow in 1899, but cannot see the Ariana Dumbledore's killer during the blasts. Later, embittered Dumbledore stands on the Wooden Bridge and reflects on this event, and concludes that in order to make the Blood Pact, the blood of both wizards was needed, so to destroy the Blood Pact's pendant, needed is the blood of people, whose veins also have the blood of wizards who made the Blood Pact. He decides to go to the Hog's Head Inn in Hogsmeade to reconcile with Aberforth. Aberforth continues to blame Albus for Ariana's death and calls him a fool for making the Blood Pact with Grindelwald, but lends him his blood. Dumbledore needs blood from Grindelwald's relative and only living is Bathilda Bagshot. Dumbledore travels to Godric's Hollow, where Bagshot finds him at the cemetery, next to Ariana and Kendra's grave. In Bagshot's house, a conversation takes place, in which Bagshot lends her blood, saying that Grindelwald has become bad, but he was a charming boy in the past, on which Dumbledore agrees. The pendant is destroyed, but Dumbledore is still afraid to face Grindelwald, because of the truth, who killed Ariana.

New informations:

* Ariana was an Obscurial
* Queenie Goldstein will be a double-agent. Maybe she is also skilled in Occlumency, and she will close her mind before Grindelwald, so that he would not know her true intentions 
* Leta Lestrange used Sacrifical Protection to save Newt and Theseus and to make them both and other friends time to escape from Lestrange Mausoleum.
* Corvus Lestrange (V) is alive and this is Abernathy (he stolen Lestrange family box, that a family member might have seen, and he nearly sank in the carriage while helping Grindelwald to escape, but was saved by him)
* Yusuf Kama dies, as he unfilled the Unbreakable Vow and he learn the truth about Corvus.

Grindelwald visits Garrick Ollivander at Diagon Alley, and gives him two phoenix's feathers to make the two powerful wands (Tom Riddle's and Harry Potter's).

&amp;#x200B;

* **FB4 - 1938, then skip to 1942**:

Battle between Dumbledore and Credence. Phoenix from Nurmengard is in reality Fawkes. He helps Dumbledore, not Credence. Credence learns from Dumbledore the truth that he isn't Aurelius and that Grindelwald only wanted to use him to assassinate Dumbledore. Credence is furious and attacks Grindelwald, Grindelwald kills him. Nagini sees the whole situation and turns into a snake permanently, swearing revenge on Dumbledore and Grindelwald.

&amp;#x200B;

* **FB5 - 1943 and skip to 1945**

**June 1943:**

The Chamber of Secrets has been opened and the Heir of Slytherin sends Slytherin's monster on muggleborn students at Hogwarts. One student, Martha Warren died. Newt Scamander arrives at Hogwarts on Dumbledore's order, and Magical Law Enforcement Department officials travelled to Hogwarts on Armando Dippet's order. Travers, Yaxley, and Theseus Scamander rule out the Killing Curse and the poison. Newt, in turn, rules out an attack by a magical creature. Moments later, Tom Riddle comes into the Headmaster's office with Rubeus Hagrid, saying that he has caught the culprit of the attacks. Dumbledore doesn't trust Riddle since their first meeting in 1938 and watches him exploratory, he suspects that Riddle framed Hagrid, because Riddle told him in Wool's Orphanage that he is Parseltongue. Hagrid is forced to reveal how he came into Aragog's possession. Newt expresses shock as to where Hagrid came into possession of the Acromantula, because Acromantula is a potential wizard killer, but also Newt ruled out being bitten by a spider as it would leave marks on the student's body. Dippet has no choice, he expells Hagrid from school, so Travers breaks Hagrid's wand. Hagrid wants to keep the broken pieces as a memento of his deceased father. Dumbledore allows him to do so and vouches for him to make Hagrid as a gamekeeper's helper.

**August 1943** \- Main thread: Newt hunts Grindelwald and counts on Dumbledore's help.

Riddle, after completing his 5th year of education, leaves the orphanage in London and travels with Nagini (now permanently in the form of a snake) to Little Hangleton. He learns in the Gaunt's shack from Morfin Gaunt that Tom's father, Tom Riddle Sr, left his mother, Merope Gaunt, and returned to the village. Riddle stuns his uncle, steals his wand and Marvolo Gaunt's ring. He goes to the Riddle's House, where, after a short, terrible conversation, he kills his father and grandparents with the Morfin's wand. He returns to Morfin and covers his tracks, implanting a false memory. Riddle, without completing the teleportation course, escapes the village with Nagini immediately under cover of night, before the Ministry representatives arrives. But the Muggle Frank Bryce, the Riddle's gardener, had seen him. Next day, Bryce is suspected by the villagers of the murder and is interrogated by the policemen in Great Hangleton. Travers, Yaxley and Theseus visits Morfin. Travers checks the last casted spell with Reverse Spell. Morfin pleads guilty and is sent to Azkaban. Shortly thereafter, Dumbledore, hearing about the event in Voldemort's hometown, visits Morfin in Azkaban, but it is too late to show the memory of meeting Riddle as Morfin dies.

At the same time, Grindelwald gets a vision of something he cared about from the very beginning: the other Deathly Hallows. He sees a vision of Riddle committing murder on his father and stealing the Resurrection Stone. He also has a vision of Fleamont Potter with the Invisibility Cloak. He wants to recruit them to his cause, however expects both of them are a threat to him, as Fleamont is Dumbledore's acquaintance and Riddle begins to dominance wizarding world as Lord Voldemort.

*For me: max 20 minutes of film. I have no idea how to elaborate on Newt, Dumbledore and Grindelwald. This is Rowling's task, I hope she will take my script into account and plan it herself.*

New informations:

* Travers and Yaxley are Grindelwald's followers.

Legendary wizards battle in Rome. Most of Grindelwald's henchmen are killed. Theseus dies as a war hero. And...  Dumbledore is using the Deluminator to find Grindelwald. The sphere penetrates his heart and he finds him at the very center of the Colosseum. Legendary duel: Dumbledore vs Grindelwald, where Dumbledore won the Elder Wand and incarcerated Grindelwald in Nurmengard.

The last scene of the fifth film: Grindelwald in his cell at Nurmengard shows Dumbledore a vision of the greatest evil that threatens the wizarding world: Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes as cameo)

Edit: Thank you for the responses :) the info we got last, around the time of FB2, was indeed that his family was ""not impressed"" by his career choice, and there has been info about them being a ""ministrial"" and ""established"" family... each info, however, relates directly to Theseus, aka how he likely rather wanted his brother to use his set of skills to help people, as an auror or healer and not have people reject him even more for choosing the magizoologist profession.

I wonder if there has been a mix-up/equalization of him and the rest of the family etc., as there is no solid info about, not even names or a number of members of the rest of the Scamander family, except for his mother's hobby of breeding hippogriffs.Any new info on Newt and Theseus' mother?"
0,"So I've been reading all the Credance/Aurelius Dumbledore theories. Seems the implication is that he is a brother to Dumbledore but I think maybe he could be the generation below. I just think looking at the ages it doesnt make sense that he's a brother. 

In FB2 Albus Dumbledore is 45, and Credance is 25. Alberforth would also have been 43. Wouldnt it be more likely that Alberforth had a child? (not Albus because gay, and frankly if JK tried to have him have had a straight sexual relationship then that's so many levels of bullshit). Also Ariana would have been too young. I do think he is a Dumbledore because of the pheonix. There are only two known tame pheonix's, one is Fawkes and the other belongs to a Quiddich team. Jk does love that kind of symbolism. 

I also dont think Credance being Albus's dark twin or Ariana's Obscurial makes sence simply because that's requiring a magical work around. JK doesnt really work like that. She like to show the humanity in wizards. Having a magical work around is just a cop out. I think it's simpler than that.

Here is where I think it could link to the prophecy of Tycho Dodonus. 

Theory 1: Albus put him self in personal ""banishment"" after what happened to his sister. Making him a son.

Theory 2: Alberforth's son aka Creadance was banished aka separated from his family [A son banished]  Ariana was devastated. She was the lone daughter in that family aka THE daughter.

Theory 3: Grindlewald is the son. He was banished from his country. 

I do think Ariana and her obscurus are the daughter's despair. Obscurials are made from despaire. I also think the avenger might be a beast, one that is integral in capturing Grindlewald.

‘what happened man?’ Lol,

I’m just having a hard time reconciling the guy who made these two fun but flawed films,

with the masterpieces that are HP5, 6, 7Pt1 and 7Pt2. 

Like who didn’t go up to Yates and say,

‘Ok, David, I think we’re laying on things a bit too thick in too many scenes — 

you can cut Newt’s Erumpent mating dance by 5 seconds at least, 

Get him to speak slightly less mumbly,

Less cliché dialogue like ‘ surrounded by the most vicious creatures....humans’,

And quite a few more issues...’

I always think it is best to have have sounding boards,

people around you who say no,

instead of stepping on eggshells —

it doesn’t matter how many billion-earning films someone has made,

They’re still fallible and need (and greatly benefit from) guidance. 

This is why I am so positive about Steve Kloves coming back for FB3 :)Constructive criticism for Yates: in all your HP films I was never made to feel excessive discomfort, however with FB1 (slightly alleviated in FB2) the characters do so many things that are either extremely loud and disruptive (Niffler shenanigans) or morose/depressing (Credence’s beating)."

Yes kinda fillers and they're trying really hard to build a franchise but still enjoyable. Johnny Depp's Grindelwald is amazing, i just loved every second he was on screen. Also Loved Jude Law very much. There are massive plot holes and timeline mistakes but I'm trying not to think about them right now.

0,"We know that during events in Paris, Leta Lestrange attended the pure-bloods ball with Theseus Scamander, Newt's older brother, where they met Yaxley. This ball was only for pure-blood wizards. Leta was pure-blood, so Theseus had to be pure-blood too, otherwise they wouldn't have let him in. We do not know what views Theseus expressed about marrying Muggles or Muggle-borns, but Newt was not against it. In addition, Newt stayed close to Dumbledore, a Muggles and Muggle-borns lover, so he was despised by Travers. So Newt is pure-blood wizard, but blood traitor.Newt Scamander is pure-blood, but he is blood traitor"

During ‘Tina Takes Newt In’ 🎼😍❤️

the equal of *Hedwig’s Theme* in every way,

And I’d love to hear it play at the start of the remaining Beasts films,

so they can have their own identity away from the Potter series.

It feels like this theme is like ‘the Wizarding World’s theme’ — 

Every time you hear it, you can feel the magic and wonder well up in your heart!I love James Newton Howard’s 13-note theme for the Fantastic Beasts films (first heard at 5:58 in FBAWTFT, ‘A Seeker After Truth’) and I believe it should take over from Hedwig’s Theme for the series!"

However, traces of the Unbreakable Vow on Yusuf Kama's hand indicate that Corvus is alive. Corvus was supposed to be Credence Barebone, but it turned out that Credene is in reality Aurelius Dumbledore (which I think is a lie, but that was on another topic). Abernathy nearly sank in the carriage, but was saved by Grindelwald as he helped him escape (Winged raven rescued from the water). Second, at the French Ministry of Magic in the Records Room, Newt and Tina came to see the Lestrange family box, but when Tina said 'Lestrange' no column turned to face them. When Leta Lestrange came, the columns turned, because she belonged to the family. The record boxes were likely to be seen only by members of the family, so they functioned as a prophecies, that only those affected could see. However, Abernathy, chased by the Aurors, impersonated unnamed older woman and Vinda Rosier allowed him to enter the Records Room. There he stole the Lestrange family box. He is also around 25/26 in FB1/FB2 and we know that action take place in 1926/1927. Corvus was born and drowned in 1901.

I mean we know it's a type of protego so it's really good defensively but it's also a very powerful offensive spell, yes I know I know Avada Kedvra but I think this may be a more powerful spell . It also almost destroyed all of Paris. I also think only really Top Tier wizards like Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Voldemort could use this spell effectively, cause it is really OP. But maybe only I think about this Spell that way. It also resembles Firefindyr because both of them are very powerful fire type Spells.

0,"If you forgot who this person I don't blame you but he was the bounty hunter who killed Irma Dugard in CoG . So the reason I find him competent is  how he handled the situation with Credence. First he knows how to be sneaky and the second he is discovered he immediately went for the kill not standing there like an Idiot and taking his sweet ass time to kill someone. And then, the moment he notices something is wrong he creates a Protego shield around him to not die and then gets out of there when he's about to get smashed.  I don't want to say that Harry Potter wizards are not competent (they are) but I'm pleased how he handled the situation even if we don't know jack shit about him, also he looks pretty powerful.

0,"I have a theory about the duel that we know will be coming in this series. I am not particularly knowledgeable with the lore, so this might not be possible. As far as we know, the true master of the elder wand at the end of Crimes of Grindelwald is somewhat ambiguous. I'm not sure if this was on purpose, or if it was sloppy. We know that Grindelwald is the true master of the wand when he faces Dumbledore, because it is in that duel that he Dumbledore wins the wand's allegiance. However, in universe, as I understand it, no matter how powerful Dumbledore is, he cannot win the duel because the wand is unbeatable, even for him. Here's what I think would be interesting: what if Newt helps Dumbledore get Fawkes? It would make sense that a Fantastic Beasts movie is when we see Dumbledore get his Phoenix. In the Order of the Phoenix book, Fawkes helps Dumbledore in his duel with Voldemort. If I remember correctly, at one point in the duel he even takes a killing curse for Dumbledore. So, in summation, if Grindelwald is the true master of the elder wand, then Dumbledore cannot beat him in a duel. But if Dumbledore bends the rules and uses his Phoenix somehow, will it be enough to win the duel and the wand? What do you all think?Dumbledore v Grindelwald duel"

0,Albus Dumbledore Will Use The Pensieve To See Who Struck Ariana And When Credence Was Created...
0,"Grindelwald told Credence that he is Albus Dumbledore's brother and that Albus want to destroy him. This is a lie from Grindelwald to manipulate Credence to use him as a weapon against Dumbledore. Even Seraphine Picquery told that he is very persuasive, so she decided to remove his tongue. He knew that Credence was the only living thing that could kill the mighty Dumbledore so he gave him a phoenix chick, told the legend of the Dumbledore family and lied to him that his real name is Aurelius.

Proofs that he can't be Dumbledore:

* Albus and Aberforth in his youth had auburn hair. Ariana was blonde. Credence had a dark hair.
* Percival died after 1892 in Azkaban. Kendra died in 1899, killed by Ariana's Obscurus. Credence was born in 1901/1904/1907
* Corvus Lestrange drowned and Credence survived in 1901, but Credence can't be born in 1901, because he would be Tina Goldstein's age and he will be older than Queenie Goldstein, he looks like 19-20.
* Credence's adoption papers said that he was born on 9th November 1904 (Date falsificated by Corvus \[IV\] to make it harder for Yusuf Kama to find Corvus \[V\])
* Ezra Miller said that Credence is 19 years old in FB1, so he was born in 1907

Only possibility that Credence is Dumbledore: he could be Albus' cousin not brother. We don't know much about Dumbledore's aunt, Honoria, and the woman featured in FB2 as 'Credence's aunt'

When I watched FB1, I suspected Credence had something to do with Lord Voldemort. In FB2, we find out who is friends with Nagini, who was once a Maledictus and later joined Voldemort.

Credence was supposed to be Corvus Lestrange \[V\]. Corvus in latin means raven. Lestrange family emblem is raven. Credence cared for the chick, who all thought was raven, but in reality was a phoenix. Voldemort had an ancestor named Corvinus Gaunt. Corvinus is diminutive from Corvus. Gaunt is Voldemort's family name from his mother side. Barebone is Credence's surname. Barebone is the synonym of Gaunt, they both means scrawny and haggard. Credence came from a known pure-blood family, everyone thought the Lestrange family.

Abernathy who helped Grindelwald in his escape from MACUSA is in reality Corvus Lestrange (V), who supposed to be dead. Corvus was born in 1901. Abernathy looks in FB1/FB2 around 25-26 years old. When he almost sank in the carriage but was saved by Grindelwald - ""the winged raven rescued from the water"". He stole the Lestrange family box from the French Ministry of Magic. Only family members could see the box, Leta Lestrange saw, but when Tina Goldstein and Newt Scamander came looking for the box and Tina called 'Lestrange', no column turned to face them. Traces on Yusuf Kama's hands after the Unbreakable Vow was still there, so Corvus is alive. Grindelwald also conjured a tongue for Abernathy that resembled two snakes. Similar had Voldemort during torturing Harry Potter at the Little Hangleton Graveyard. Was it supposed to show any connection with Slytherin?Credence is in reality... Corvus Gaunt and he is a Salazar Slytherin's descendant? And proves that he is not Aurelius Dumbledore... and Abernathy is lost Corvus Lestrange"
0,"First option: Due to the fact that the blood of two wizards who swore not to fight with each other was needed to create the Blood Plact, to destroy the pendant Dumbledore will need to use the blood of people related to the people who formed the Blood Pact. In the case of Dumbledore and Grindelwald, Albus will need the blood of Aberforth and Bathilda Bagshot.

Second option: Dumbledore will use Godric Gryffindor's sword. It didn't matter how old Dumbledore was: 18, 46 or 116, the sword could appear to any deserving Gryffindor. Dumbledore was a Gryffindor student during his school days.

Third option: if the pendant was from metal, Dumbledore would use a Philosopher's Stone borrowed from Nicholas Flamel. Stone could turn metal into gold.

Fourth option: Dumbledore will use dragon blood to destroy the pendant, because he has discovered 12 ways to use it.

0,What is your perfect ending to the final movie?
0,"Besides the released 10 deleted scenes, deleted trailer shots, promotional stills, interview info and more reveal:

* Dumbledore pointing at the Mirror of Erised (possible extension of the existing Mirror scene with more characterisation)
* Dumbledore with an Order of the Phoenix book (possibly talking to Flamel?)
* Shot of Newt's book-signing (possibly before the Ministry bring him in)
* A bar scene between Newt and Theseus, described by Redmayne, that explains the Newt/Theseus/Leta dynamic
* Shots of Leta and Theseus talking when they visit Dumbledore at Hogwarts
* Shots of Tina entering Yusuf Kama's sewer hideout, and a shot of the Lestrange family tree projected onto the sewer wall- possibly revealing Kama is hunting the Lestranges earlier on
* More shots of Queenie at the Ministry and Queenie talking to Grindelwald, suggesting extended sequences
* A whole scene with Queenie and Grindelwald in a garden, probably expanding on her persuasion
* Redmayne mentioned a moment of Tina and Leta working together to protect Newt at the Ministry
* Moment of Nagini attacking Yusuf in reptilian form in the Lestrange Crypt (I believe this in the screenplay)
* Extended Leta backstory, including Credence's aunt being named and a moment Redmayne describes where Leta breaks down. 
* Shots of everyone on the Parisian rooftops at sunset, crying as Flamel brings them croissants.

Combine these with the 10 deleted scenes we know of (an extra 13 minutes) and the movie could've been 20+ minutes longer. This is super frustrating, especially as even the Extended Edition of CoG is 14 minutes shorter than the THEATRICAL cut of *Chamber of Secrets,* and 34 minutes shorter than its extended cut.

Are there any other deleted scenes that anyone knows of?Are there any more deleted Crimes of Grindelwald scenes we know of?"
0,"Yeah i am bored...

People are sure Credence will die in FB because he's not in HP. I don't think that needs to be true. JK Rowling simply hadn't made up FB yet and she doesn't let that fact cramp her story telling. Plus: There is no knowledge of obcurials living past the age of 10 in HP either and that is in FB so...

Anyway. Trying to crawl in JK's mind. We know the Blacks are pureblood and knows to litterary scratch out 'Blood traitors' from their family tree.

It is possible, HP-canon wise, the blacks thought Credence a squib somehow. Then send him away. Or perhaps one of his parents married a muggle or not a pure-blood wizards and the parent's, as well as the baby, where severly punished for the crime of 'muddying' the blood line.

And/Or Credence may 'betray' the black bloodline with not beeing completely loyal to wizards. I could see him beeing so pissed of at fellow wizards he will rather help the humans who raised him, rather then wizards who tried to kill him. First MACUSA, then Scender ain't a nice guy, the bounty hunter, then i bet he won't be friends with Grindelwald for to long....)

So he could end up beeing one of the wizards beeing scratched out on the Black family tree. Heck might even still be alive (Dead is not the same as beeing kicked out of the family in disgrace after all. Or are they confirmed to be deceased?)

which also ties is nearly with JK saying that Crecence becomes a 'notable' character in HP universe. He's kinnda notable as he's on the Black family tree. He's face is scratched out but the name still remains. Kinnda notable.

Ah, probably not.... Yet it's kills a bit of the time till FB3 comes out and we'll know for sure.

I kinnda hope i am right now. Just so i can yell ""Yes i knew it! I knew it al allong!!! Bow to me ya mortals!!!!!!""Could Credence Barebone be a member of the Black family?"

I have no idea how long does it take from ending shooting to the finalization, but I believe the date won't change (unless filming has to stop again). 

Do you guys think the film will make its original release date or, with the delays, postponing it is inevitable?Backing from November 2021?"

David Yates has destroyed every Wizarding World movie he has directed despite great screenplays! Order of the pheonix was OK+! Exept Sirius’ death! It was just so unnatural even on screen! And the half-blood Prince was AWFUL!
But every film he has directed from HP 5-8 and FB 1 and 2 have always had me leave the theater thinking WHAT? Something is always missing. And always either a weird choice in directing or a camera angel or something from the script That never made it into the film! 

Let me just bring up one directing choice That still bugs me! Other than Sirius’ death!

In HP 8
The colour of Voldemorts’ robes fades througout the movie! Yates said this was to «untold, to show That Voldemort was being weakened!» But why on Earth didn’t he make Voldemort seem more dark and dangerous as the book would suggest rather than a Voldemort who is decrepid and weak despite, at That point, being the most powerful and dangerous dark wizard in the World!

Why oh why Yates! Just jump of a bridge and let someone with directing and creative talent take over!Anthony &amp; Joe Russo should direct the upcoming fantastic beasts movies!"

I'm saying this because i haven't seen this theory pop up much, yet wouldn't it be the best ending for her, as well as a good narrative twist?

Credence and Nagini's stories currently mirror each other: they are both ""cursed"" with a malevolent force inside of them, which takes control of their body and threaten to take over their mind permanently as well.

Newt in the first film mentioned how he'd managed to extract an obscurus, but the girl holding it didn't survive the process. The emotional resolution to this story would have him figuring out how to succeed in this operation, this time with Credence. If this is possible for him, why wouldn't it be for Nagini?

Of course i can't tell you ""how"" this would happen, but this is a magical universe. Who knows what can be done?We think Nagini's story is bound to end up tragically, but what if…"

Not the Godric's Hollow time, that should be fleshed out in FB3, but why he was expelled for Durmstrang (that should connect him, in a way, to Newt) and why/how he got so determined to end Statute of Secrecy. Anyway, those answers have to be given in a way that makes sense and I started to think of a reason. What if to destroy the blood pact, blood from both Albus and Gellert's families are required. That would take us to Aberforth (or maybe there's really an Aurelius) and to the Grindelwalds. What you guys think?Blood Pact and the Dumbledores and Grindelwalds"
0,"&amp;#x200B;



Has anyone noticed that the serpent tongue conjured by Grindelwald forAbernathy resembles that of Voldemort? Will there be any ties to Voldemort in the FB movie?

OK. Credence supposed to be Corvus Lestrange (V). Leta Lestrange swapped baby Corvus for Credence on the ship in 1901. Corvus sanked, Credence survived. Yusuf Kama made an Unbreakable Vow and promised to kill Corvus. Credence find his adoption papers and birth date on it: 9th November 1904. Date on the document was falsificated by Corvus Lestrange (IV) to make it difficult for Kama to find Credence. Ezra Miller said that Credence is 19 years old in FB1, which takes place in 1926, so he is 20 in FB2, which takes place in 1927. In the cafe Kama still had scares on his hand, so Corvus was still alive. Kama told Credence that he is raven rescued from the water, because emblem of the Lestrange family was raven, and Corvus in latins means raven.

Grindelwald told Credence that he is Aurelius Dumbledore, and the chick, for whom Credence cared was a phoenix, and that the phoenix will come to help him in dire need.

But Credence can't be Aurelius Dumbledore, this person never existed. Percival died shortly after 1892, so the phoenix could not help him in escape, and otherwise his escape from Azkaban would have been recorded by the dementors. Also last known Dumbledore with the phoenix before Albus was Albus' great grandfather. Kendra died in 1899. Albus and Aberforth had an auburn hair, Ariana was blonde and Credence was dark-haired.

Barebone and Gaunt are synonyms and means a bony and emaciated person. Voldemort had an ancestor named Corvinus Gaunt. Corvinus is a diminutive from Corvus. Is he Voldemort's cousin? Corvinus, Rionach and Gormlaith Gaunts must have an ancestor, which had a brother. This brother could be Credence's ancestor.

The family box in the Ministry could only be seen by a member of the family, just as the prophecy could only be retrieved by the person concerned. Abernathy impersonated an old lady and broke into the Records Room in the French Ministry of Magic and stole the Lestrange family box. During Grindelwald's escape, he nearly sank into the carriage, but was saved by Grindelwald. Is he the winged raven rescued from the water?

In this case means Abernathy (Corvus Lestrange V) was sent to America on another ship, on the other ship, on which was Irma Dugard and Leta Lestrange, there were unknown babies and one of them sank. Credence, on the other hand, was born in 1907.

There is no possibility that Credence is Aurelius... Grindelwald knew that Credence was the only living person, that could kill Dumbledore. Grindelwald couldn't kill Dumbledore because of the Blood Pact, he made with Dumbledore, so he wanted to use Credence as a weapon. So he lied to him that he was abandoned by his brother and Albus wants to kill him.

This serpent tongue, Credence befriending Nagini, Barebone = Gaunt, Corvinus = Corvus...

I asked about Fantastic Beasts 3 and he said he was working on it at the moment, and the wands for it are very cool. He also said there were several new names he didn’t recognise, when being given the designs with the characters’ names on and that he wasn’t a fan of some of them. Not to say they’re bad at all, but he said earlier that he wasn’t too fond of the Beasts style wands, with the metal accents and more manufactured style. He much preferred the organic ones, like Grindelwald’s and Gregorovitch’s so I’m assuming that means we’ll be seeing some more of the 20s/30s style of wands with metal clasps and non-wood materials in a few.

There are a lot of rumors about Hagrid, I think there will be a whole story with the Chamber of Secrets. Perhaps Newt will come to Hogwarts to tell Dumbledore that it wasn't Aragog who killed Martha Warren, because Aragog would have left traces. Maybe they will want to put Newt to Azkaban, because I think Travers is a henchman of Grindelwald because he despises Dumbledore and Newt. Also Grindelwald have his agents at USA (Abernathy) and France (Rosier), so he need Travers. Also Yaxley from the deleted scene. Maybe at Hogwarts they will come up with the idea of ​​organizing the Triwizard Tournament, but due to numerous disappearances, the tournament will not take place. Maybe we'll see the last Quidditch World Cup before the war, maybe in Brazil. It was probably the original Order of the Phoenix to fight Grindelwald, because Flamel and Dumbledore had a book with a drawn phoenix. There was also an alternative to the prophecy - the predictions of Tycho Dodonus.

0,"I have seen this theory on Twitter and it actually makes sense so I’m going to share it

You can read it [here]( (It’s in Spanish but I took the liberty to translate the theory. Also, I have permission to publish it because the authors and I are close friends)

***Fantastic Beasts Theory***

*“Is it possible that Credence Barebone is not Albus Dumbledore’s brother, but Porpentina Goldstein´s?”*

&amp;#x200B;



To begin, I want to tell you that this theory is something that we have discussed with the administrators of [this account]( among many of the theories that we have, and that it emerged in a chat group, talking with other fans of the Fantastic Beasts saga.

Therefore, I know that this theory may sound far-fetched, we thought so in the beginning, but the more we looked for information about it, the more details we found that seemed too on the nose.

Let’s start with Credence Barebone. Originally, it was believed that this character was much younger than the protagonist quartet, but after his adoption certificate was made public, we were able to know his “true” date of birth, cited as November 9, 1904.

&amp;#x200B;



 This would make him 22 years old by 1926, when the first movie is set. His adoption certificate is the paper that Credence finds at his house the day after his first Obscurus transformation, in a deleted scene, which motivates his search for his true family. 

 



Now let’s go to what Dumbledore told Newt about Credence. “I know this, an Obscurus grows in the absence of love, as a dark twin, an only friend. If Credence has a real brother or sister out there who can take its place, he might yet be saved”

Dumbledore seems to be talking about the fact that if Credence had an actual brother or sister, someone who could really love him, he could save himself from his Obscurial condition, which could lead him to his death, and is actualy a rare thing to mention, considering the end of the movie.

 



And this fact, although overlooked because Dumbledore uses the words “dark twin”, which is quite confusing by itself, gives us the idea that he could be aware that Credence has a living brother, although he is not necessarily talking about himself.

Which brings us to the next point. Credence was not born on the date it says its adoption certificate. If we move to the mausoleum scene, where Leta tells us the story about how he switched his brother Corvus with the baby that turned out to be Credence, we have one more clue.

According to the screenplay, the ship where these events occur, was sailing in 1901, which is why Credence, being about the same age as the baby Corvus who was recently born, should have been born recently as well.

 



This leads us to recalculate Credence’s age. If he was born in 1901, by 1926, his age would be 25 years, only four years younger than Leta and Newt. Another important fact is that the woman he was traveling with was not his mother, if not his aunt, also according to the screenplay.

What does this mean? Well, coincidentally there is another character who was also born that same year and is someone we know a lot, but maybe not so much. Porpentina Esther Goldstein.

According to her MACUSA identification card, Tina Goldstein was born on August 19, 1901, which would make her and Credence the same age. And we have several reasons to think that these two characters could be brothers, as Dumbledore suggested, or even twins.

 



First, Tina and Queenie don’t look alike. Neither the physical appearance, nor the color of eyes, nor the color of the hair or the fact that one has curly hair and the other does not. And we know that this is only circumstantial data, but let’s take a look at their mother.

In the first movie, when Tina is about to be sentenced to death, we see her memories of her parents. And in these, we see her mother, who is very similar to Queenie although she doesn’t have much resemblance to Tina.

&amp;#x200B;



 Also, the fact that Tina and Credence are quite similar. Pale, straight black hair, dark eyes, similar features. Even, Credence’s aunt we see in the second movie is also quite similar to Tina 

&amp;#x200B;



 In addition, Tina feels a certain attraction to Credence even though she doesn’t really know him. It’s like she has an instinct to protect him and the compassion she felt for him led her to risk his career and, in the second film, embark on a trip to Paris to find him 

 



The theory then is: Credence and Tina are twins and they are from Europe. They arrived at the US on the boat where Leta and Corvus were traveling. For unknown reasons, Credence was in her aunt’s cabin, while Tina was in another cabin with his mother or father (or both).

When the ship sank, Credence’s aunt died trying to rescue baby Corvus while Leta had accidentally saved Credence’s life. Whoever was traveling with Tina did not survive the shipwreck either, but Tina did.

Once in the United States, Tina is adopted by the Goldstein marriage as her own daughter and for Credence, we already know that he ended up with Mary Lou Barebone.

Another option is that the Goldstein marriage would have been traveling on that ship with baby Tina and baby Credence and also with an aunt. So, what could have happened is that the Goldstein considered their son deceased in the wreck and that they had never told Tina that she had a twin

Reasons to dismiss this theory are many, but let´s remember three things:

1. In Tina’s biography, it says she has “at least” a sister named Queenie. The reason for this is the fact that in the future, a character named Anthony Goldstein appears, who was confirmed by Rowling as a very distant relative of the sisters and by bearing the family name and being them the “only” Goldsteins we know up until now, there may be a third brother who can pass the last name to future generations

2.Dumbledore suggested that Credence could have a brother and that it would be the key to his salvation. In the same way he suggested to Leta that “Confession is a relief, I´m told. A great weigth lifted” as if he knew what she had done to Corvus. In general, he usually knows much more than he says. So he could know more about Credence´s origins than he appears

3.Rowling usually plans his stories very well and uses a resource called “foreshadow” very skillfully, in which she leaves small clues and details that are irrelevant until we have the full story and then is when that details become important

One more thing in favor of the theory is that on the Nagini and Credence´s poster, if we zoom in on the symbols that are above their heads, she has a snake while he has a salamander, probably as a symbol of his relation with Tina

When I saw FB1 in the cinema, I never realised this is poster describing Nagini's performance in Circus Arcanus. It wasn't until the FB2 trailer itself, having watched FB1 at home 15328 time, that I paused the movie and looked more closely. As it turned out, Nagini was later in The Crimes of Grindelwald.

There is also the mention of Harry Potter's grandfather at the beginning of the 1st movie in the Daily Prophet. We know that Grindelwald owned the Elder Wand and he was looking for the remaining Hallows, and Fleamont Potter was in possession of the Cloak of Invisibility. Does that mean Harry's grandfather will appear in the next movies? It would also mean that Voldemort might appear in the film, because the action takes place in 1926-1945, and Voldemort came into possession of the Resurrection Stone in 1943.

Next are Philosopher's Stone in Flamel's house or book with Phoenix on it, and possibly Fawkes himself.

&amp;#x200B;Things you found in previous FB films, and you think will be in next parts."
0,"&amp;#x200B;

* Ariana Dumbledore was an Obscurial. Description of her 'illness' is very similar to Credence's. In addition, they were both considered as a squibs. Ariana was beaten by three muggle boys and Credence was regularly beaten by his adoptive mother. Ariana was being calming down by Aberforth, as was Credence by Newt and Tina.
* Ariana was killed by Grindelwald, therefore Grindelwald escaped from Godric's Hollow.
* Grindelwald killed someone at Durmstrang, this is why he was expelled.
* Blood Pact was made before battle between Aberforth, Albus and Grindelwald. Breaking the Blood Pact had fatal consequences and one of them was Ariana's death, when Dumbledore and Grindelwald faced each other in an argument with Aberforth. Other possibility is that Blood Pact was similar to the Unbreakable Vow - if wizards who swore not to fight each other and would duel one-on-one, and pendant with mixed blood of both wizards still would existed, they would probably died. In this case, the fight in Godric's Hollow didn't count as Blood Pact was about a one-on-one duel, and Albus, Aberforth and Grindelwald fight each other.
* Obscurial couldn't be killed when he released the Obscurus, because the Obscurus was breaking into pieces and then the pieces were fusing back together, causing the Obscurial to survive, this is why Credence survived.
* Swooping Evil's venom wasn't erasing all memories, only the bad ones, this is why Jacob was not fully obliviated.
* Grindelwald will not be able to kill Newt, because Leta used Sacrificial Protection, sacrificing herself, so Newt, Theseus, Tina, Yusuf, Jacob and Nagini can escape from the Lestrange Mausoleum.
* Credence was not an Aurelius Dumbledore. Grindelwald lied to Credence to used him as a weapon to kill Dumbledore, because Grindelwald can't kill Dumbledore himself due the Blood Pact he made with him.
* Grindelwald tricked Credence into believing he is Dumbledore's brother and that Albus want to kill him. Grindelwald gave him a chick in Paris, where everyone thought it was a raven, because Credence was supposed to be Corvus Lestrange. The emblem of the Lestrange family was a raven, and Corvus in Latin means raven. According to the Tycho Dodonus' predictions, Credence was to be a ""son cruelly banished"" and a ""winged raven rescued from the water"". In Nurmengard Grindelwald showed the chick, which was in reality a phoenix.
* This phoenix will be Fawkes. There will be a story of how he came into possession of Albus and how he would give feathers to the two wands (Harry Potter's and Lord Voldemort's)
* There will be a fight between Dumbledore and Credence, in which Credence probably will die. Either he will believe Dumbledore and attack Grindelwald and thus will die from his hands, or Dumbledore will be forced to kill him.
* Nagini will become a snake permanently when Credence will die. She will be so furious at Dumbledore and Grindelwald, that she will become angry and join Lord Voldemort in the future.
* Queenie will be a double-agent, due her legilimency skills. She is probably skilled in Occlumency as well.
* Theseus Scamander and Yusuf Kama also will die. On the bad side they will be Vinda Rosier and Abernathy.
* Newt Scamander will marry Tina Goldstein, because he lived with her in Dorset. They had a grandson named Rolf, which married Luna Lovegood.
* Jacob Kowalski will marry Queenie Goldstein, because during the 2014 Quidditch World Cup was USA Player named Quentin Kowalski.
* Dumbledore will destroy pendant with the Godric Gryffindor's sword. It didn't matter how old Dumbledore was, the sword could appear to any deserving Gryffindor. The second possibility, less likely, if the pendant was made of metal, he could destroy pendant with a Philosopher's Stone, that could melt the metal into gold. Third, with a dragon blood, because Dumbledore discovered 12 uses of dragon's blood. (Known are oven cleaner, spot remover, a cure for verruca and ingredient used in brewing potions)
* Grindelwald will be searching for other Deathly Hallows: Resurrection Stone and The Cloak of Invisibility. We know the action of FB takes place between 1926 and 1945. During this time Fleamont Potter was in possession of the Cloak of Invisibility and Tom Riddle was in possession of the Resurrection Stone. If Grindelwald was a Seer and saw Credence in his vision, could he saw Harry's grandfather and Harry's deadly enemy? Did he want to recruit them to his cause? Or want to steal from them other hallows?
* The duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald will take place in Godric's Hollow, because this place was very important to them. Here they met, shared plans, made Blood Pact and here Ariana died.
* Ezra Miller said that Credence is 19 years old in FB1, so he is born in 1907. When he found his adoption papers there is a birth date 9th November 1904. The date was falsificated by Corvus Lestrange (IV) to make it harder for Yusuf Kama to find Credence. There is also said that Leta swapped Corvus (V) for Credence on the ship trip in 1901. So it's hard to deduce when Credence was really born.
* Barebone is the synonym of Gaunt. They means the same. Voldemort, in addition to Merope, Morfin and Marvolo Gaunt, he had such ancestors as Corvinus Gaunt, Gormlaith Gaunt, Rionach Sayre, and Isolt Steward. Corvinus is the diminutive of Corvus. A similar case to Half-Blood Prince (Severus Snape was Prince, and his mother was Eileen Snape nee Prince). Is this Credence's real name? Corvus Gaunt? If so, one of Corvinus', Gormlaith's and Rionach's male distant ancestors, must have had a brother. Credence may have come from this brother's lineage. Thus, Marvolo Gaunt did not know of Credence's existence as the Gaunt family was almost extinct.
* Corvus Lestrange was swapped before trip to America and is alive. Corvus (IV), hearing that Kama had sworn to kill Corvus (V), he sent his son to America on another ship and replaced him with an unknown child. On the another ship, Leta swapped the unknown child, who supposed to be Corvus, for Credence. The child sank and Credence survived. Scars from the Unbreakable Vow were still on Yusuf's hand, so Corvus (V) had to live. Abernathy is in reality Corvus (V). Only a member of the Lestrange family could see the box in the Ministry, and Abernathy stolen it. He is also a 'winged raven rescued from the water', because during helping Grindelwald in escape from MACUSA, he almost drowned in the carriage, but was saved by Grindelwald.
* JK Rowling answered to the question of what is Newt's patronus, that ""it's a big spoiler"". Newt's patronus is occamy. This beast was very important to him, because this creature hatched when Newt befriended Jacob, and the same animal is caught by Newt and Tina, which fall in love with Newt. You can immediately answer what will be Tina's patronus. Newt revealed to her that she had eyes like a salamander. The salamander is Tina's patronus.
* JK Rowling answered to the theory, that Obscurus is a small dementor, that ""she love the thought"". The dementors were the worst creatures in the world, they drained all the happiness and joy from the world, replacing them with sorrow, regret and hatred. Everywhere they appeared, it was unnaturally cold, everything was freezing. The Obscurial's emotions resembled those spread by the dementors. In addition, in Newt's suitcase, the separated Obscurus of a Sudanese girl was placed in a frosty habitat. The Dementors were born out of a black fog, and the Obscurus was like a black fog.
* There is also a theory, that Newt gave Hagrid an aragog's egg. Newt, as a magizoologist, would hardly be so unwise to give such a dangerous beast to a thirteen-year-old half-giant. Hagrid was given a dragon egg by Quirinus Quirrell on Voldemort's orders. The basilisk egg was placed in the Chamber of Secrets by Salazar Slytherin. The acromantula egg must have been given by a dark wizard or his follower. Could it be Grindelwald?
* Newt was a Parselmouth. He had an ashwinder's frozen egg. He had also two runespoors in his suitcase. He must used Parseltongue to catch them, because to call graphorns or catch erumpent, he also used the language of these beasts.
* Minerva McGonagall was born on October 4, 1935. She graduated from Hogwarts in 1954 and started teaching there in 1956. Previously, she worked for two years at the British Ministry of Magic. During her school days, she was a top student and was using the Time Turner to pass the exams best. In the Ministry, she worked in the Department of Mysteries in the Time Chamber. During one of the experiments, there has been an incident and McGonagall travelled back in time to 1910. She only told Dumbledore about her secret. 
* Has anyone else noticed the similarity between the Voldemort's Dark Mark and Grindelwald's skull-hookah for sharing a visions? Skull had a rope as long as a snake. Skull has also a date 1898 on it and inscription 'Für das Größere Wohl', what means 'For the Greater Good'

In 1926 Gellert Grindelwald saw a vision of powerful obscurial killing Albus Dumbledore, related to Credence Barebone. He travelled to New York and assumed identity of Percival Graves, MACUSA Auror, by Human Transfiguration.

I believe that Grindelwald, having no need to use Graves, killed him.

Other possibility is that Grindelwald, who wasn't killing for fun like Lord Voldemort, incarcerated Graves in Nurmengard.What do you think happened with Percival Graves?"

[Is this what will happens in FB3? Fight between Credence and Albus?](

***I wrote a synopsis of two parts of FB and the story of Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Whoever does not want to, should not read, the most important thing is at the bottom.***

**Summary**:

Percival and Kendra Dumbledore lived on the Mould-on-The-Wold and had three children: Albus, Aberforth and Ariana. In 1892 Ariana was attacked by muggle boys, and since from this moment she began to suppress magic and emotions. When Percival killed this muggles, he was sentenced to Azkaban, so Kendra moved with children to the Godric's Hollow. At this moment Albus started attending Hogwarts and was sorted into Gryffindor.  He was a top student and created an international network of wizards.

The Godric's Hollow villagers suspected Ariana to be a Squib, because she rarely left the house and never attended Hogwarts, like her brothers. She was sweet and innocent, but she was dangerous during the explosions, only Aberforth knew how to calm her. In 1899, during one of the blasts, she killed her mother, Kendra. Albus quit traveling with Elphias Doge to stay as head of the family, but he met Gellert Grindelwald, who came to his aunt, Bathilda Bagshot, and to examine in the local cemetery the grave of Ignotus Peverell, one of the three brothers (Antioch and Cadmus are others) who were the first to possess the three Deathly Hallows: the Cloak of Invisibility, the Resurrection Stone and the Elder Wand. Albus and Gellert both befriended, they both shared their visions of mastery over Muggles and they wanted to find all hallows. They also made a Blood Pact, where they swore to never fight each other, and mixed blood of them was placed in pendant, which Grindelwald owned. When Aberforth heard about boys' plans, Grindelwald was not happy and said Ariana would not have to hide and Aberforth was a fool. He casted the Cruciatus Curse on him. Albus tried to protect Aberforth by shouting to Grindelwald not to hurt Aberforth and Ariana. Enraged by the flashes, Ariana approached her outburst, but was hit by a Killing Curse and fell dead. Grindelwald used the Portkey at Bagshot's house and fled, he didn't want to be charged with Ariana's death, because he had something on his conscience since he was kicked out of Durmstrang.  Ariana rested next to Kendra, and Aberforth blamed Albus for Ariana's death. Albus was afraid that he himself had accidentally killed Ariana.

Few years after duel in Godric's Hollow, Grindelwald stolen from Mykew Gregorovitch's wandshop the Elder Wand and started his rise to power. He wanted to create an army of Inferi with the Resurrection Stone, but the hallow did not work that, because it was only bringing back the spectres of the dead from beyond the grave. At the same time, Albus started teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts in Hogwarts. Dumbledore had put off meeting Grindelwald for years, not only because due the Blood Pact, but also because he was afraid of the truth who killed Ariana. Grindelwald gathered many followers and constructed Nurmengard in Austria, a prison, where Grindelwald's enemies ended.

Grindelwald was very interested in the subject of Obscurials, young wizards, who were suppressing their magic and emotions and were releasing the Obscurus, a parasitic black force that was destroying everything around. Grindelwald was a Seer and in 1926 he saw a vision of powerful Obscurial from New York, killing a man he feared above all others, Dumbledore. He also saw that Obscurial is related to Credence Barebone. He travelled to North America and by Human Transfiguration he assumed the identity of Percival Graves, MACUSA Auror and the right hand of Seraphine Picquery, MACUSA president. He contacted Barebone, who has been regularly beaten by his adoptive mother, Mary Lou Barebone. Dumbledore, anticipated Grindelwald's steps, so told Newt Scamander, famous magizoolog and his former student, about the illegally imprisoned Thunderbird in Egypt. Newt told Dumbledore that this beast's natural habitat was Arizona, also North America, so Dumbledore ""unknowingly"" sent Newt to New York to capture Grindelwald. Newt kept his beasts in his suitcase with a Extension Charm. As a result of exchanging suitcases with the muggle Jacob Kowalski, he allowed the release of magical creatures from his suitcase. Jacob was beaten by one of the creatures, so Newt is tasked with finding the lost creatures before revealing the wizarding world for disclosure. During his stay in America, he met his future wife, Tina Goldstein, and her sister Queenie, who felt in love with Jacob. Tina worked as an Auror, but she was delegated to the Wand Permit Office, where Queenie was working, due the attack on Mary Lou Barebone, whose memory had to be erased. Newt prepared Jacob a cure for a murtlap's bite and showed him the rest of the beasts in his suitcase, including the Swooping Evil, which venom could erase bad memories. When Newt and Jacob found niffler and erumpent, they went into the suitcase, but did not know that Tina had carried the suitcase to MACUSA. During this time Senator Shaw has been killed. In MACUSA Newt stated that the Obscurial killed the muggle.  Jacob was supposed to have his memory erased and Grindelwald blamed Newt, who kept in his suitcase an Obscurus of an 8 years old Sudanese girl, which was useless without the host. Grindelwald sentenced Newt and Tina to death, but they were saved by Queenie and Jacob, who was apprehended from the Obliviator's hands by Queenie. Newt, Jacob and Goldstein sisters find other beasts: Demiguise and Occamy. Shortly after the Second Salem Church was destroyed by and Mary-Lou Barebone was killed by the Obscurial. Grindelwald thought that the Obscurial must be a child, so he took Credence to help find Modesty, Credence's young adoptive sister. Grindelwald sensed in Credence that he comes from an ancient pure-blood family, but he has no powers, so he insulted Credence as a squib. Angered Credence revealed himself as an Obscurial and destroyed half of the New York. Grindelwald wanted to use Credence to murder Dumbledore, so he tried to convince him to join his cause. Newt has set itself the goal of saving Credence. He could calm him down, but Grindelwald prevented him. Newt battled Grindelwald, but Credence enraged by the flashes, approached his outburst. Tina came and calmed him down, but shortly. Credence was supposed to be killed by Aurors on Picquery's orders, because he revealed the wizarding world to be exposed. Furious Grindelwald was catched by Newt and Tina, so Newt revealed his true identity, causing to Grindelwald being imprisoned in MACUSA prison. Newt released the Thunderbird and threw him the Swooping Evil's venom. The Thundebird flew away towards the sky, causing a rainstorm and erasing memories from Muggles, including Jacob.

However, Credence survived the fight, because the Obscurial could not be killed in his Obscurus form. Credence head to the destroyed Second Salem Church, where he killed Mary Lou and he found his adoption papers. He found out from the papers that he was from Paris. He also saw on the wall of the building next to the church a Circus Arcanus' poster with a description of the 'Snake Girl' performance in New York. He joined the circus, where he serverd as a helper. He befriended there Nagini, the female maledictus, a wizard who had a blood curse, which cause her to turn into an animal and after some time she would be trapped in the body of a snake forever. He travelled with circus to Paris and during the Nagini's performance they both run away. During this time Grindelwald escaped from prison with the help of Abernathy, his follower and Wand Permit Office supervisor. Grindelwald travelled to Paris to convince Credence once again. At the British Ministry of Magic in London, Newt learned from Theseus, his brother and Head of the Auror Office, that Credence had survived and been sighted in Europe. Newt was banned from international traveling after events in New York so he can't meet with Tina. He lied to Torquil Travers, Rudolph Spielman and Arnold Guzman, that Dumbledore sent him to America, and refused to become an Auror and kill Credence. He met with Dumbledore, who told Newt about the rumors that Credence supposed to be Corvus Lestrange (V), a lost member of pure-blood family, and half-brother of Leta Lestrange, Newt's friend and Theseus' fiancee. He ordered Newt to go to Paris and save Credence, and he gave Newt a home address of Nicholas Flamel, the creator of the Philosopher's Stone, to find refuge in his house in case something went wrong.  Newt was reluctant, because he feared imprisonment in Azkaban under the supervision of the dementors. Newt returned to his home at 9 Sherringford Square, where he helped Bunty, his assistant, who was in love with him, to feed the beasts. To his surprise, he was visited by Queenie and Jacob, who did not have his memories completely erased. As it turned out, Queenie casted a love charm on Jacob, because in America no wizards were allowed to marry Muggles, due Rappaport's Law. Newt lifted the spell off and Queenie teleported away, leaving a postcard. Newt and Jacob deduced from the postcard that Tina was in Paris looking for Credence, and Queenie will travel to Paris to search for Tina. They both head to Dartmoor, where they left illegaly used Portkey and left England for France. Tina met Yusuf Kama, french wizard of senegalese descent, who was Leta's half-brother and the last member of the pure-blood Kama family. He took an Unbreakable Vow and promised to kill Corvus Lestrange (V), who was supposed to be Credence. He told her about Tycho Dodonus' predictions and took her to his hideout in the sewers where he imprisoned her. Newt came to the rescue with Jacob, but they were also imprisoned. Kama fainted, as it turned out he had a water dragon parasite in his eye. Newt catched a Zouwu, which escaped from Circus Arcanus' show, so he apparated with others to the Flamel's house, where he got rid of the parasite from Kama's eye. Unable to find Tina in the French Ministry of Magic, Queenie met Vinda Rosier, a Ministry employee. She took her to the apartment where Grindelwald was waiting, so he tried to get Queenie to join his cause. Grindelwald also ordered Gunnar Grimsson, the bounty hounter, who was ordered to kill Credence, to murder Irma Dugard, half-elf, which Credence and Nagini visited to find out the truth about Credence. During the interrogation at Hogwarts, Travers tried to force Dumbledore to fight Grindelwald, but the Dumbledore refused, so Travers conjured him admonitors and forbaded teaching at Hogwarts. Dumbledore again anticipated Grindelwald's steps and expected the dark wizard will call a rally for his followers, so he ordered Theseus not to interfere. Dumbledore also warned Leta not to blame herself for Corvus' death, as she had unintentionally contributed to his death when she was small. He also said he had blamed himself for Ariana's death for years. Newt and Tina noticed that Grindelwald was calling his followers by sending black banners with the emblem of the raven, showing that the meeting would be held at the Lestrange Mausoleum in Pere-Lachaise Cemetery, because the Lestranges' emblem was a raven. Newt and Tina went to the French Ministry of Magic to find a box that would tell him who Credence really was. They met Leta and all of them discovered that the box had been moved to the Lestrange Mausoleum. Due to the travel ban, Newt was wanted so he used a polyjuice potion with Theseus' hair, and when they were discovered by Melusine, they were attacked by matagots. Newt hid the girls in a suitcase and retrieved Zouwu, thanks to which he was immediately able to get to the Pere-Lachaise cemetery, due Zouwu was able to jump the entire city in one jump. At mausoleum they met Jacob and Yusuf, who wanted to kill Credence and Nagini. Leta found the box and saved Credence by confessing the truth, that she didn't know who he was and that Corvus sank in 1901, when she exchanged him for Credence.  On the spot, it turned out to be a trap and they came across a Grindelwald rally. When Grindelwald portrayed the Aurors as brutal and one pure-blood female wizard was killed, Grindelwald sent his followers to spread the truth. Queenie and Credence joined Grindelwald. A fight ensued and Newt faced Grindelwald once again. As a result of the fight, Leta sacrificed herself so that Newt, Theseus, Tina, Yusuf, Jacob, and Nagini could escape. Before Grindelwald escaped, he wanted to destroy Paris with the Protego Diabolica, but Nicholas Flamel came to the rescue and helped them fight the fire with counter-course. After battle Newt discovered, that Grindelwald's pendant was stolen by Newt's niffler and Newt delivered the pendant to Dumbledore, so that he can destroy it and face Grindelwald. In Nurmengard Grindelwald spoke with Queenie about Credence, because she was skilled in legilimency. Grindelwald gifted Credence with a wand and told him, that chick, for which Credence cared in Paris was a phoenix. He also told him that in his family is a legend that a phoenix will fly to any member in dire need and told him that he is Aurelius Dumbledore and his brother, Albus, seeks to destroy him.

**Conclusions**:

* Ariana Dumbledore was an Obscurial. Description of her 'illness' is very similar to Credence's. In addition, they were both considered as a squibs. Ariana was beaten by three muggle boys and Credence was regularly beaten by his adoptive mother. Ariana was being calming down by Aberforth, as was Credence by Newt and Tina.
* Ariana was killed by Grindelwald, therefore Grindelwald escaped from Godric's Hollow.
* Grindelwald killed someone at Durmstrang, this is why he was expelled.
* Blood Pact was made before battle between Aberforth, Albus and Grindelwald. Breaking the Blood Pact had fatal consequences and one of them was Ariana's death, when Dumbledore and Grindelwald faced each other in an argument with Aberforth. Other possibility is the fight in Godric's Hollow didn't count as Blood Pact was about a one-on-one duel, and Albus, Aberforth and Grindelwald fight each other.
* Obscurial couldn't be killed when he released the Obscurus, because the Obscurus was breaking into pieces and then the pieces were fusing back together, causing the Obscurial to survive, this is why Credence survived.
* Swooping Evil's venom wasn't erasing all memories, only the bad ones, this is why Jacob was not fully obliviated.
* Grindelwald will not be able to kill Newt, because Leta used Sacrificial Protection, sacrificing herself, so Newt, Theseus, Tina, Yusuf, Jacob and Nagini can escape from the Lestrange Mausoleum.
* Credence was not an Aurelius Dumbledore. Grindelwald lied to Credence to used him as a weapon to kill Dumbledore, because Grindelwald can't kill Dumbledore himself due the Blood Pact he made with him.
* Grindelwald tricked Credence into believing he is Dumbledore's brother and that Albus want to kill him. Grindelwald gave him a chick in Paris, where everyone thought it was a raven, because Credence was supposed to be Corvus Lestrange. The emblem of the Lestrange family was a raven, and Corvus in Latin means raven. According to the Tycho Dodonus' predictions, Credence was to be a ""son cruelly banished"" and a ""winged raven rescued from the water"". In Nurmengard Grindelwald showed the chick, which was in reality a phoenix.
* This phoenix will be  Fawkes. There will be a story of how he came into possession of Albus and how he would give feathers to the two wands (Harry Potter's and Lord Voldemort's)
* There will be a fight between Dumbledore and Credence, in which Credence probably will die. Either he will believe Dumbledore and attack Grindelwald and thus will die from his hands, or Dumbledore will be forced to kill him.
* Nagini will become a snake permanently when Credence will die. She will be so furious at Dumbledore and Grindelwald, that she will become angry and join Lord Voldemort in the future.
* Queenie will be a double-agent, due her legilimency skills. She is probably skilled in Occlumency as well.
* Theseus Scamander and Yusuf Kama also will die. On the bad side they will be Vinda Rosier and Abernathy.
* Newt Scamander will marry Tina Goldstein, because he lived with her in Dorset. They had a grandson named Rolf, which married Luna Lovegood.
* Jacob Kowalski will marry Queenie Goldstein, because during the 2014 Quidditch World Cup was USA Player named Quentin Kowalski.
* Blood Pact was similar to the Unbreakable Vow - if wizards who swore not to fight each other and would duel one-on-one, and pendant with mixed blood of both wizards still would existed, they would probably died
* Dumbledore will destroy pendant with the Godric Gryffindor's sword. It didn't matter how old Dumbledore was, the sword could appear to any deserving Gryffindor. The second possibility, less likely, if the pendant was made of metal, he could destroy pendant with a Philosopher's Stone, that could melt the metal into gold. Third, with a dragon blood, because Dumbledore discovered 12 uses of dragon's blood. (Known are oven cleaner, spot remover, a cure for verruca and ingredient used in brewing potions)
* Grindelwald will be searching for other Deathly Hallows: Resurrection Stone and The Cloak of Invisibility. We know the action of FB takes place between 1926 and 1945. During this time Fleamont Potter was in possession of the Cloak of Invisibility and Tom Riddle was in possession of the Resurrection Stone. If Grindelwald was a Seer and saw Credence in his vision, could he saw Harry's grandfather and Harry's deadly enemy? Did he want to recruit them to his cause? Or want to steal from them other hallows?
* The duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald will take place in Godric's Hollow, because this place was very important to them. Here they met, shared plans, made Blood Pact and here Ariana died.
* Barebone is the synonym of Gaunt. They means the same. Voldemort, in addition to Merope, Morfin and Marvolo Gaunt, he had such ancestors as Corvinus Gaunt, Gormlaith Gaunt, Rionach Sayre, and Isolt Steward. Corvinus is the diminutive of Corvus. A similar case to Half-Blood Prince (Severus Snape was Prince, and his mother was Eileen Snape nee Prince). Is this Credence's real name? Corvus Gaunt? If so, one of Corvinus', Gormlaith's and Rionach's male distant ancestors, must have had a brother. Credence may have come from this brother's lineage. Thus, Marvolo Gaunt did not know of Credence's existence as the Gaunt family was almost extinct.
* Corvus Lestrange was swapped before trip to America and is alive. Corvus (IV), hearing that Kama had sworn to kill Corvus (V), he sent his son to America on another ship and replaced him with an unknown child. On the another ship, Leta swapped the unknown child, who supposed to be Corvus, for Credence. The child sank and Credence survived. Scars from the Unbreakable Vow were still on Yusuf's hand, so Corvus (V) had to live. Abernathy is in reality Corvus (V). Only a member of the Lestrange family could see the box in the Ministry, and Abernathy stolen it. He is also a 'winged raven rescued from the water', because during helping Grindelwald in escape from MACUSA, he almost drowned in the carriage, but was saved by Grindelwald.
* JK Rowling answered to the question of what is Newt's patronus, that ""it's a big spoiler"". Newt's patronus is occamy. This beast was very important to him, because this creature hatched when Newt befriended Jacob, and the same animal is caught by Newt and Tina, which fall in love with Newt. You can immediately answer what will be Tina's patronus. Newt revealed to her that she had eyes like a salamander. The salamander is Tina's patronus.
* JK Rowling answered to the theory, that Obscurus is a small dementor, that ""she love the thought"". The dementors were the worst creatures in the world, they drained all the happiness and joy from the world, replacing them with sorrow, regret and hatred. Everywhere they appeared, it was unnaturally cold, everything was freezing. The Obscurial's emotions resembled those spread by the dementors. In addition, in Newt's suitcase, the separated Obscurus of a Sudanese girl was placed in a frosty habitat. The Dementors were born out of a black fog, and the Obscurus was like a black fog.
* There is also a theory, that Newt gave Hagrid an aragog's egg. Newt, as a magizoologist, would hardly be so unwise to give such a dangerous beast to a thirteen-year-old half-giant. Hagrid was given a dragon egg by Quirinus Quirrell on Voldemort's orders. The basilisk egg was placed in the Chamber of Secrets by Salazar Slytherin. The acromantula egg must have been given by a dark wizard or his follower. Could it be Grindelwald?
* Newt was a Parselmouth. He had an ashwinder's frozen egg. He had also two runespoors in his suitcase. He must used Parseltongue to catch them, because to call graphorns or catch erumpent, he also used the language of these beasts.
* Minerva McGonagall was born on October 4, 1935. She graduated from Hogwarts in 1954 and started teaching there in 1956. Previously, she worked for two years at the British Ministry of Magic. During her school days, she was a top student and was using the Time Turner to pass the exams best. In the Ministry, she worked in the Department of Mysteries in the Time Chamber.

0,"Although I wasn’t the biggest fan of FB2, (mainly for the broad cast and little runtime for each character), I’m honestly really excited to see what the third film does with these characters. In the second film we were introduced to Nagini, Yusuf, and Theseus, yet for the first two we unfortunately didn’t get a lot of development. While Theseus got a fair bit more, there’s still so much we have yet to find out about him. I hope with the third film the cast will be slightly smaller so we can really see the abilities of Nagini shine, see Theseus and Newt’s relationship develop, (especially after Leta’s passing), and I’d like to see what Yusuf has to offer. Although we barely know much about him, his character was very intriguing for me, especially the hints of friendship with him and Nagini at the end. It’ll be interesting to see how he aids Newt and the others, and if he remains a key character in the next film (hopefully he doesn’t get killed like Leta, it would be such a waste).

The monkey loses the wand after he bangs it on a rock, as it releases sparks – and he is blown away. 

So can anyone make sparks come out of the wand? Isn't wandcraft limited to wizardfolk? 

In the history of magic, wands are the point of contention with goblins, the sparkpoint for war. Goblins, who have powerful magic of their own, do not possess the knowledge to wield wands. They are specialist instruments for wizards and witches.

1.ARIANA DUMBLEDORE WAS AN OBSCURIAL!!!!!

We know that obscurials were young wizards who suppressed their magic and emotions, as a result of physical or mental abuse. They were releasing an obscurus, the parasitic black energy, that was destroying everything around.  An obscurus separated from its host is useless and cannot survive on its own for long. The obscurial could not be killed when he freed the obscurus, because the obscurus will be shattered into many pieces, and then the pieces will fall back together and, in this case, the obscurial further lives. We know that Credence Barebone (Corvus Lestrange/Aurelius Dumbledore) was an obscurial, because his adoptive mother Mary Lou Barebone was beating him regularly. Gellert Grindelwald did not believe that Credence could be an obscurial, and in a fit of anger, called him a squib, sensing his magical roots, but his lack of ability. Due Aberforth Dumbledore's words, Aberforth's and Albus' sister, Ariana, was nice and gentle most of the time, when she was calm, she helped him feed the goats. But there were times when she was furious, strange and dangerous, often resulting in outbursts like the one who killed their mother, Kendra. That is typical reference of an obscurial. She also was suspected by people in Godric's Hollow, that she was a squib, because she never went to Hogwarts.



2.ARIANA DUMBLEDORE WAS KILLED BY... GELLERT GRINDELWALD!!!!!!!!!!!!

Bathilda Bagshot had revealed to Rita Skeeter that shortly after Ariana's death Grindelwald came back shaky and used the Portkey to leave Godric's Hollow. Aberforth Dumbledore told Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger in the Hog's Head Inn in Hogsmeade that Grindelwald run away, because he already had something on his conscience in his country, he did not want to be accused of Ariana's death yet. In Limbo, after destroying the Horcrux in Harry Potter's head by Lord Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest, Albus Dumbledore told Harry that Grindelwald lost control, but Dumbledore never revealed to Harry who killed Ariana. Presumably during the fight between Aberforth, Albus and Grindelwald, she tried to free the obscurus and break the duel between the three wizards, which also led to her death, where Grindelwald casted the killing curse. However, Aberforth never blamed himself for Ariana's death, unlike Albus. I suspect that in the 5th film, during the duel between Albus and Grindelwald in 1945, Grindelwald will try to lie to Albus that Albus killed Ariana and that she was the first person, who died ""For The Greater Good"". J.K. Rowling once revealed herself that she ""thought she had made it clear enough who killed Ariana"".



3.BLOOD PACT WAS MADE BEFORE FIGHT BETWEEN GRINDELWALD AND ABERFORTH AND INTERFERENCE OF ALBUS!!!!!

We know that in 1899, when Gellert Grindelwald arrived to Godric's Hollow to explore the grave of Ignotus Peverell, he met Albus Dumbledore and planned with him to rule over the Muggles and plan to find the three Deathly Hallows: the Cloak of Invisibility, the Resurrection Stone and the Elder Wand. During this time they also made a Blood Pact and the mixed blood of both wizards was in the pendant that Grindelwald was having. I think, that Blood Pact is similar to the Unbreakable Vow. When you swore an Unbreakable Vow, you promised to kill someone, if you did not complete the task, you would die. In this case, if Grindelwald and Dumbledore had faced a duel, and the pendant with their blood still existed, both wizards would have died. I also think that the fight where Grindelwald used the Cruciatus on Aberforth and Albus tried to interfere (probably by using a shield charm) doesn't count, because it was a one-on-one duel.



4.CREDENCE IS NOT AURELIUS DUMBLEDORE. THIS IS A LIE FROM GELLERT GRINDELWALD!!!!!

In the end of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Gellert Grindelwald revealed to Credence Barebone, who supposed to be Corvus Lestrange, that he is Aurelius Dumbledore. We know that pure-blood wizards suspected that Credence has to be son of Corvus (IV), the Corvus (V) and half-brother of Leta Lestrange. Corvus in latin means raven. During the Leta flashbacks in 1927, we see that Newt Scamander in 1910 is caring for a raven chick. When Grindelwald is gathering his followers in Paris to go to the Lestrange Mausoleum on Pere-Lachaise Cemetery, he sends a black curtains with the sign of the raven, and the raven is the emblem of the Lestrange family. We also saw, that Credence is caring for a chick in Paris, all people probably thought that was a raven. But in Nurmengard, in Austria, Grindelwald revealed to Credence that was not a raven, but a phoenix, and that in his family there is a legend that phoenix will fly to one of its members when he is in dire need or distress. He also revealed him that his brother, Albus, wants to destroy him, he gives him a wand and a name: Aurelius Dumbledore. THAT IS A LIE! In the deleted scene from Crimes of Grindelwald, Dumbledore after creating the fog and using the Deluminator in London to avoid being seen by the Ministry of Magic agents, Albus told Newt Scamander that many years ago he has heard the rumors that Grindelwald had a vision in which the obscurial kills the man Grindelwald feared the most, to which Newt responded ""you"". We know that later after one of the battles somewhere in Europe, Grindelwald had a vision in which he saw the obscurus destroying New York and the face of Credence. Grindelwald traveled to New York and Paris to use Credence as a weapon against Dumbledore, because he can't fight with Dumbledore himself due the Blood Pact. To make Credence even more fooled, he gave him a phoenix, but probably during the Credence's fight with Dumbledore, which will probably occur in 3 or 4 part of the film, the phoenix will help Dumbledore. (THAT IS PROBABLY FAWKES, HIS ORIGINS AND HOW HE GET INTO DUMBLEDORE'S POSESSION, THERE ALSO WILL BE SEQUENCE HOW FAWKES GIVES TWO FEATHERS TO TWO WANDS: HARRY POTTER'S AND LORD VOLDEMORT'S. THEN DUMBLEDORE GIVES THE WANDS TO OLLIVANDER)



5.NAGINI WILL TRANSFORM INTO A SNAKE PERMANENTLY, WHEN CREDENCE WILL DIE!!!!!!!!!!!

In Circus Arcanus, Credence befriendend Nagini, the maledictus. We know that the maledictus is a wizard, who has a blood curse and has the ability to transform into an animal when he want, like the animagus, but the animagus acquires these abilities and the maledictus has them from birth, and over time the maledictus transforms into this animal permanently, possibly as the effect of any traumatic event. Probably this moment will come when Credence will fight Dumbledore. Option 1: Dumbledore will tell Credence the truth of who he is and that Credence is not Aurelius and his brother. Credence will attack Grindelwald and will die as a result. OPTION 2: Credence will not believe in Dumbledore's words, and Dumbledore will be forced to kill him with a help of the phoenix. Grindelwald will say that this is another person that Dumbledore sacrifices ""For The Greater Good"". In both cases, Nagini finds that if it weren't for Dumbledore and Grindelwald's war, Credence would be alive, as a result of which she transforms permanent into a snake and vows revenge by joining Lord Voldemort in the future.


6.DUMBLEDORE WILL DESTROY BLOOD PACT'S PENDANT WITH GODRIC GRYFFINDOR'S SWORD!!!!

We know that after the Battle in the Lestrange Mausoleum, Newt Scamander delivered Albus Dumbledore the pendant with mixed blood of Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald. We also know that Dumbledore wasn't ready to duel Grindelwald until the pendant wasn't destroyed. We know from the Harry Potter books that Dumbledore was sorted into Gryffindor, and that the sword will reveal only to the true Gryffindor.


7.NEWT SCAMANDER AND THESEUS SCAMANDER WERE PURE-BLOODS, BUT ALSO BLOOD TRAITORS!!!!!!!!!

In the deleted scene from Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Leta Lestrange and Theseus Scamander attended the ball of pure-blood wizards in Paris. Only purebloods were allowed to attend this ball, so Theseus had to be pure-blood, which automatically meant Newt Scamander too. However, since Newt stayed close to Albus Dumbledore, who was a half-blood wizard and a Muggle and Muggle-born wizards enthusiast, it meant Newt was a blood traitor. Newt was also not against marrying Muggles. Theseus probably shared Newt's views, since he also had a relationship with Dumbledore.


8.NEWT SCAMANDER'S PATRONUS WAS... AN OCCAMY AND TINA GOLDSTEIN'S WAS... A SALAMANDER!!!!!

In one of the reviews, J.K. Rowling when asked what is Newt's patronus, she replied ""a big spoiler"". I think that Occamy will be, because this the beast, that he catches when he befriends Jacob Kowalski, the muggle. Later, he catches the same creature and falls in love with Tina Goldstein, with whom it is known that sooner or later he will get married, have children and will live in Dorset. So I think this creature is very important to him, if not most important, besides the niffler and the bowtruckle. Tina's patronus will be salamander... In the first and second installment of the FB films, there are the songs called ""Newt Says Goodbye To Tina"" (first film) and Salamander Eyes (second film), where Newt and Tina have their touching moments (farewell at the port in the New York, confessing the truth at the Ministry of Magic in Paris)


9....THIS MEANS THAT IN THE NEXT PARTS THERE WILL BE... A DEMENTORS?

If Rowling said that revealing Newt's patronus is a big spoiler, it means the patronus will be in the next movies, so he must have used this spell against the Dementors (or maybe Lethifold, against which the Patronus Charm is also used). We know that third movie will take place in Brazil. Isn't that a good place for dementors to appear? The country of the favela and the spectre of the Second World War and the Global Wizarding War against Grindelwald provide a good backdrop for the dementors. These are sad thoughts that they might feed on. (Death of Leta and death of next person)


10.WAR REQUIRES CASUALTIES, THEREFORE NEXT PERSON WILL DIE...

I think that Credence Barebone, Theseus Scamander and Yusuf Kama are good candidates for killing, although I am sad to including them on this list.


11.OBSCURUS IS A... SMALL DEMENTOR?

We know that the Obscurus feeds on emotions similar to those of dementor's: sadness, regret, hatred, despair. As if that was not enough, in Newt Scamander's suitcase, the obscurus of an 8-year-old Sudanese girl was floating in a Snowy Habitat. It is known that in every place where dementors appeared, it was unnaturally cold and everything was frozen. The dementors were born of the fog and were all black, and the obscurus was like a black fog, something similar to horcrux, which Harry Potter and Ron Weasley opened in the Forest of Dean. Does it mean that horcrux is also somehow related to obscurus? Regarding the topic that the obscurus is a little dementor, Rowling herself wrote that she liked the theory.


12.WHO GAVE HAGRID THE ARAGOG'S EGG?????

There is a theory that Newt Scamander gave Rubeus Hagrid the Aragog's egg. I think this theory is wrong, because although Newt was a traveler and Hagrid was given an egg by a traveler, Newt was a magizoologist and he would not knowingly give a thirteen-year-old half-giant, but still a thirteen-year-old, an acromantula egg. Newt classified acromantula in his Fantastic Beasts book as XXXXX, a potential wizard killer. But... ""I mean how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pocket""... We know that Quirinus Quirrell on Lord Voldemort's orders give Hagrid the egg of Norwergian Ridgeback dragon. Also how many people wander around with basilisk eggs in their pocket... Salazar Slytherin placed the basilisk at Hogwarts... So how many people wander around with acromantula eggs in their pocket...? Maybe Grindelwald albo someone from Grindelwald's acolytes.


13.CREDENCE'S OBSCURUS IS ARIANA'S OBSCURUS?

There is a theory that after Ariana died, her obscurus was so powerful that it placed in Credence. This is one of the most nonsensical theories I have read about on the internet. Credence was beaten by his adoptive mother and became an obscurial, and Ariana was beaten by three Muggle boys and was probably an obscurial too. This theory simply reminds how a part of Voldemort's soul placed in Harry making him a horcrux.


14.BRASIL! SAMBA! RIO DE JANEIRO!

Exactly what is Brazil associated with? With the 2014 FIFA World Cup. I suspect that in FB3, Newt will take Jacob to the Quidditch World Cup, looking for a way to destroy the blood pact pendant along the way. We know that during the First Wizarding War (1970-1981) and the Second (1995-1998) the Quidditch World Cup was canceled. The same was probably during the the First and Second World Wars, but what about the interwar period? Isn't the last time we should see some quidditch?


15.QUEENIE GOLDSTEIN WAS A DOUBLE-AGENT!!!!!!!!!!

Queenie Goldstein was skilled in legilimency, so she can read someone else's mind. But can't she also be skilled in occlumency? I think she will later close her mind against Gellert Grindelwald. She will be a kind of double agent. Later she probably marry Jacob Kowalski, because there was a USA quidditch player known as Quentin Kowalski.


16. THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX TO FIGHT GELLERT GRINDELWALD!!!!

The book with phoenix on it, which Nicolas Flamel had in his home in Paris to contact Albus Dumbledore to talk about Gellert Grindelwald's rally in Lestrange Mausoleum at Pere-Lachaise Cemetery. Unfortunately, Dumbledore was busy, so Flamel contacted Eulalie Hicks, a teacher from Ilvermorny. Probably there was the first Order of the Phoenix to fight Grindelwald and Flamel was one of his members. Probably others were: Newt Scamander, Theseus Scamander (double-agent at British Ministry), Tina Goldstein, Queenie Goldstein (double-agent at Grindelwald's acolytes), Yusuf Kama, Eulalie Hicks...


17.CREDENCE BAREBONE'S ADOPTION PAPERS WITH THE FALSE DATE OF BIRTH!!!!!

We know that Corvus Lestrange and Credence Barebone were switched on the ship during the trip to New York in 1901. Corvus Lestrange drowned and Credence survived. However, when Credence found his adoption papers there is a birth date on it: November 9th, 1904. The date is false because Corvus (IV) heard that Yusuf Kama had taken an Unbreakable Vow and promised to kill Corvus (V), so on the document the date was falsified to make Kama difficult to find Corvus (V), who was supposed to be Credence.


18.GRINDELWALD, DUMBLEDORE AND NEWT WERE PARSELMOUTHS LIKE HARRY AND VOLDEMORT!!!

We know that Dumbledore communicated with centaurs, goblins, trolls, merpeople... Visiting the Pensieve with Harry Potter, he understood what Voldemort and Morfin were talking about in the Parseltongue. However, Dumbledore did not use this speech because it was sorcerous.  We know Dumbledore told Harry that he didn't need the Cloak of Invisibility to become invisible, a Disillusionment Charm would suffice for that. He also himself described Grindelwald as a wizard slightly inferior to him in witchcraft. Does that mean Grindelwald was also a Parselmouth? And Newt... in the deleted scene from Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them, Newt had a two runespoors in his suitcase. Runespoor is a three-headed snake. Newt showed that he was able to communicate with the graphorns and erumpents. Does that mean he used a Parseltongue to catch the runespoor?


19.DID DUMBLEDORE WAS LOOKING FOR THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS?

I think Dumbledore was looking for the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets in 1943, because he knew it was Voldemort who opened it, from the moment Voldemort told him in Wool's Orphanage that he is parseltongue. Dumbledore also knew that Voldemort was related to the Gaunts, so shortly after the murder of the Riddle family and the imprisonment of Morfin Gaunt in Azkaban, Dumbledore paid a visit to Morfin to get a memory from him. Dumbledore also knew that Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets and that he was innocent, so he vouched for him and told Armando Dippet to make Hagrid as a helper of the gamekeeper Ogg. Dumbledore, to make sure, probably alerted Newt Scamander to check if Aragog was able to kill Martha Warren (he was, but not in that way, not by looking).


20.GRINDELWALD HAD A VISION OF TOM RIDDLE AND FLEAMONT POTTER!!!!!

We know that Grindelwald wanted to collect all of the Deathly Hallows. Shortly after Ariana's death he stolen the Elder Wand from Mykew Gregorovitch's wand shop. Grindelwald was also a Seer and he saw a vision of an powerful obscurial. At the beginning of the first part of the movie, we see newspaper clippings, and the Daily Prophet mentions Harry Potter's grandfather, Fleamont, who created the  Sleekazy's Hair Potion, which Hermione Granger used during the Yule Ball. Fleamont thus quadrupled the Potters' wealth, but Grindelwald might have had a vision of a man in glasses from Godric's Hollow having the Cloak of Invisibility. When Voldemort arrived at the Gaunt shack in the Little Hangleton, he stunned his uncle Morfin Gaunt, took his wand and went to the Riddle house where he killed his muggle father and grandparents with Morfin's wand. Then he came back and implanted his uncle with a false memory and stole from him the ring with the Resurrection Stone on it. Grindelwald may have had a vision of a young man from Little Hangleton carrying the last hallow. Does that mean Grindelwald wanted to recruit them both, just like Credence? Maybe he wanted to visit Riddle at Wool's orphanage in London?


21.CREDENCE BAREBONE IS CORVUS... GAUNT!!!!!

Gaunt and Barebone are synonyms. Gaunt means scrawny, haggard. Barebone means skinny, scrag. In Circus Arcanus, Credence befriended one of the most loyal Lord Voldemort's servants, Nagini. Credence is from the old pure-blood family... but not Lestrange. Voldemort, in addition to Merope, Morfin and Marvolo Gaunts, had an ancestor named Corvinus Gaunt, who lived in the 1700s and hid the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets under the sink when the elaborate plumbing system was installed in Hogwarts.  ""Corvinus"" also is the diminutive of ""Corvus"", which derives ""raven"". Credence supposed to be Corvus.


22.GRINDELWALD KILLED SOMEONE IN DURMSTRANG?????

Grindelwald was expelled from Durmstrang in 1899, due his twisted experiments, even in a school famous for teaching the dark magic, they stopped turning a blind eye to his antics. Aberforth Dumbledore told Harry, Ron and Hermione in Hog's Head Inn in Hogsmeade, that Grindelwald had something on his conscience before Ariana died. Does that mean he murdered someone in Durmstrang?


23.DUMBLEDORE'S AND GRINDELWALD'S DUEL IN 1945 WILL TAKE PLACE IN... THE GODRIC'S HOLLOW!!!!

I think that this legendary duel will take place, where it's all started, where Grindelwald met Dumbledore, where they made a Blood Pact, where they share their plans for searching the Deathly Hallows and coming out of hiding from the muggles, where Ariana was killed.


24.DUMBLEDORE REPAIRED HAGRID'S WAND WITH THE ELDER WAND

After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter fixed his wand with the Elder Wand. Probably in the same case, Dumbledore, after winning the duel vs Grindelwald, used the Elder Wand to repair Hagrid's wand, then placed it in an pink umbrella.


25.GRINDELWALD'S LAST VISION

When Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald and imprisoned him in one of the cells of Nurmengard, a fortress that Grindelwald built for his enemies, Grindelwald will likely give Dumbledore a vision of the worst evil that the wizarding world will face: LORD VOLDEMORT.


A lot of content and reading, but what do you think about it?Possible plot for Fantastic Beasts 3!!! And maybe 4 and 5"
0,"... Newt working up the courage to propose to Tina but then the niffler steals the ring so the plot basically turns into Newt and Jacob frantically trying to chase down the niffler. 

And Tina and Queenie be like:
""Have you seen Newt?""
""No... Have you seen Jacob?""
""No""
""Huh""
""Probably causing havoc and making a mess of something. They'll probably just turn up in a week or so!""
""Hmmm""

I would definitely watch that!The third film should totally be about..."

0,"After initially not paying too much attention to the Fantastic Beast movies. I’ve grown to really like them after rewatching them this past weekend. It’s great to see the Wizarding universe from another point in time. I know critics and some loyal Harry Potter fans aren’t thrilled with them so far, but they’re better than what’s been put out there about them. Not A+ movies but a good B+ for both of them in my opinion. 

The end of the second movie when Grindelwald calmly handles all the aurors is by far the best scene in the prequels. To think that they would search for Dumbledore because he was his equal just shows the insane power they had. Makes me wonder how Voldemort would do against either of them at this time. 

Jumping ahead thought, can’t wait to see the duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald.Rewatched both movies again"
0,"\- I think that the solution for the blood pact is the mcuffin for FB 3 and the rise of grindewalds army (and in the 3 act we will get the beginning of the wizarding war. I think that in this one jacob will die at the end (so quennie can join the good guy in FB 4). We will see Nagini's blood curse worsening and we will see joseph die. Also the whole credence is a Dumbledore plot will get resolved (he isn't a dubledore, but he is from a very powerful bloodline. i t wouldn't mind if he is the brother of Leta al along). Theasius will have PTSD and will see Leta telling him she failed him, in a battle with grindewald and his forces he will get injured badly but he will not die. I whould like a battle at the ministry of magic in the third act so grindewald can take over the ministry (Grindewald whould also kill the minister)  


\- FB 4 is posibly more a character movie. i think the plot will focus more heavily on Dumbledore and his relationship with grindewald (and why he doesn't wanna fight grindewald). at the side of the baddies especially the band with credence and grindewald. credence is more rebellious and is leaning more to the good site. At the end he will die by the hands of grindewald in a big battle against grindewald (the group + credence vs grindewald) we will see the group turmoil in the group. Quennie is defesteaded because of jacob and the only thing she wants is revenge for jacob. (because of this she loses focus and in a battle between quennie, Tina and a right hand of Grindewalt, Tina will die becasueshe saves quennie. after he has defeated by grindewald theusius will get more reckless (he whould die in the same battle as credence. Nagini whould turned fully snake in act 2. we whould see more of tom riddle in Hogwarts. In the bigger picture we will see the wizarding war in full scale.  


\- FB 5 is the big finally (it's remenisent with DH 2 because the movie will be full on action). The movie is leading to the big battle (ACT 3 is full on battle the good guys fighting the forces of Grindewald but the focus will be on Dumbledore vs Grindewald). In act 2 we will see Newt die. I don't really have the story for this one ready but we need to see why grindewald is more dangerous then voldemort. also Quennie will die and Newt will posibly die (but Newt will be more depress becasue Tina and thesieus have died)

And I'm not gonna talk about people who don't believe him. It's their fault, 'cause they don't wanna believe him. When you show them the evidence, they'll block you.

0,"Reasons being...

1. We know nothing of Merope Gaunt's mother (Voldemort's grandmother)
2. Marvolo Gaunt was in Azkaban around the time Credence was conceived - makes sense that his wife would want to have him sent far away (if she'd had an affair, especially if it had been with a Muggle) where Marvolo couldn't kill him
3. Merope may actually be half-Muggle or not Marvolo's daughter; hence, his contempt for her and hence, we know nothing about his marriage - he probably hated his wife and had her banished
4. After said sordid affairs, Merope's mother fled (or was banished by Marvolo) and maybe even remarried (a Potter?)

If this is true, Credence (the son cruelly banished) is looking to avenge his poorly-treated mother whose abuse by Marvolo (possible banishment) was devastating for Merope (despair of the daughter).

And we should expect Credence to kill Marvolo Gaunt in the next film....? (incidentally he dies in 1928 - approximately 2 years after the first film)

If Marvolo Gaunt's wife had an affair with someone at Godric's Hollow (Henry Potter? after all, we know nothing about his wife), this would be just the right time for Ariana Dumbledore's Obscurus to attach itself to the unborn baby Credence Gaunt. If Merope's mother ends up actually marrying Henry Potter and being great-grand mother of Harry Potter, this would hardly be surprising.Credence Barebone = Merope Gaunt's stepbrother"

&gt;MA: Yeah. Speaking of Dumbledore.

&gt;***JKR: Bless his little heart.***

&gt;MA: We wanna talk about Dumbledore so bad. We know that you've created worldwide intrigue when you said that he is gay. But I wanted to ask you about homosexuality in the Wizarding World in general. Is it a taboo?

&gt;***JKR: Now, that's something I never thought of. I would think that that would be-- it would be exactly what it is in the Muggle World. But the greatest taboo in the Wizarding World is, well, for some wizards... I mean if we're talking about prejudiced people within the Wizarding World, what they care most about is your blood status. So I think you could be, um, gay, pure-blood, and totally without any kind of criticism from the Lucius Malfoys of the world. I don't think that would be something that would interest him in the slightest. But, you know, I can't answer for all witches and wizards because I think in matters of the heart, it would be directly parallel to our world.***

&gt;MA: Hrmmm. Yeah. The reaction was so astronomical to that.

&gt;***JKR: Well, I said it to you, Melissa, before I think, that to me, it's wrong not to answer a question honestly. I just think that's immoral. And I was asked that question by a young woman at Carnegie Hall who prefaced her question by saying ""these books have helped me be more fully myself"". Well, I mean, that's just one of the most wonderful things anyone has ever said to me about the books. And then she asked, ""Has Dumbledore ever been in love?"" So I was absolutely honest about how I saw the character: I always imagined that Dumbledore was gay. How relevant is that to the books? Well, it's only relevant if you considered that his feelings for Grindelwald, as revealed in the 7th book, were an infatuation rather than a straight-forward friendship. That's how I think-- In fact, I know that some, perhaps sensitive, adult readers had already seen that. I don't think that came as a big surprise to some adult readers. I think a child would see a friendship, and a very devoted friendship. But these things also occur. So I-- How relevant is it? Well to me, it was only relevant in as much as Dumbledore, who was the great defender of Love, and who sincerely believed that Love was the greatest, most powerful, force in the universe, was himself made a fool of by Love. That to me was the interesting point. That in his youth, he was-- he became infatuated with a man who was almost his dark twin. He was as brilliant, he was morally bankrupt, and Dumbledore lost his moral compass. He wanted to believe that Grindelwald was what he wanted him to be, which is what I think, particularly, a young person's love tends to do. We fill in the blanks in the beloved's personality with the virtues we would like them to have. So Dumbledore was wrong. And his judgment was entirely-- was very suspect at that time. And of course, it was more than being infatuated. Grindelwald appeared to be offering him a solution to this horrible dilemma. I mean, Dumbledore was not cut out, to his shame, to be a carer. He was cut out to go out on to the world stage and be a brilliant man. He knows say ""Dumbledore's past"", but you know, Dumbledore's family would be a profitable line of that about himself, and he's ashamed of it. So it's a complicated issue, but, yeah, that's the way I always saw Dumbledore, it wasn't a particularly big deal to me. And I never, once before, been asked at an event, about Dumbledore's romantic life. I've been asked other things about him. But I have to say that until ""Hallows"" was published, people were mostly interested in the Trio's futures and Dumbledore's backstory. In fact, I remember, Melissa, when you and Emerson interviewed me after ""Half-Blood Prince"" was published, we were talking about what fans should be asking. And I said, ""Dumbledore's family."" I didn't want to inquiry because I always knew that he had this tragic story from his late teens. There. That was a long answer.***

&gt;SU: That was brilliant.

&gt;***JKR: But it was a full answer.***

&gt;MA: We love full answers.

0,"Unpopulair opionion i know. But i think the lack of news is causing the franchise irreparable damage.

Besides the hardcore fans the general audience (95% if not 99%) are 'casual audience'. As in they go 'Hey, new movie out. Let's go see it!'

Almost 2 years! have gone by with virtually NO NEWS AT ALL! Audiences are forgetting this francise exsists. They are forgetting the 2 movies they already saw. To long without a mention. And it's still well over a whole year away. 

So when 3 finally comes out people's reactions are going to be: Yeah i think i saw 1 and 2.... Forgot exactly how they went. 2 was pretty bad not gonna re-watch them to i can understand 3. Or 'Wasn't that franchise cancelled? Huh this movie probably sucks to ain't gonna bother'.

Yeah i know it's Corona. So what? You may not have photo's but you can KEEP THE FLOW GOING, Fuck post a new Twitter header. Give us the title. Some cast announchment. A vague concept art picture. A vague set picture (They had sets done as they just starting shooting when Corona shut it down) It's not going to spoil the movie but it WILL generate some actual buzz. Makes people remember this franchise isnt cancelled. Maybe they think about seeing 1 / 2 again because they are locked in their houses. Instead of waiting till it's so far back in people's mind that they just forgot a movie they say once 3!!!! years ago....

It bugs me to no end movies like the Flash that will come out in 2022 still have an actual BUZZ going! It's trending on Twitter. Newsites are reporting ACTUAL TIDBITS of movie news.

But FB seems to be completely DEAD. There is 0 going on. Even this reddit is dead.

Even i am starting to drop out. The cast don't seem to care, WB don't seem to care (They do about all their OTHER upcoming movies) even JK Rowling seems to have lost all interest in it. She's only posting about her Ikabod series, her views on transgenger or her OTHER books. 

Fuck if even Rowling seems to have completely lost interest (How many FB related tweets did she awnser in the last 18 months? ZERO!) why should i care?

Their ruining their own franchise with this complete radio silence. What other A+ movie is getting this bad a treatment? This seems to be doomed by their own mismanagement. This is going to cost them a lot of revenue when it finally does come out. Probably fucking up the changes of a 4th and 5th movie. How well FB3 will do it going to be the factor of the budget of 4 and 5. It if underperforms like 3, this will NOT affect 4 and 5 in a positive way

Edit: thanks for the responses everyone. First, I agree that you don’t want to introduction of Tom Riddle to take over from developing Grindewald (who some claim to be just as if not more powerful). 

I have two main reasons for hoping he does come in a bit. 1. His back story is fascinating and dark and mysteries so it would be cool to see it explored just a bit alongside Dumbledores character development as a teacher (as was said down below). We saw it a bit in book 6 but not really in the movies. 

2) I may address this in a later post but I think it would be so cool to see a short movie series on Voldemort’s first rise to power so maybe the next three FB movies could dedicate small amounts of screen time to setting that up.Will Tom Riddle be in FB a lot?"

0,"I had the beginnings of this theory walking out of CoG the first time but I finally got around now to putting it all down together, so here we go:

Many have theorized, as I do, that Ariana Dumbledore was an Obscurial. A Pottermore/WW.com article recounts the story told about her in Deathly Hallows: 

""‘When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, set upon, by three Muggle boys. They’d seen her doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge: she was a kid, she couldn’t control it, no witch or wizard can at that age. What they saw scared them, I expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and when she couldn’t show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.’  
*Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*

The brutal attack on young Ariana left her scarred and damaged, mentally unstable and afraid to perform magic. Her powers ‘turned inwards’, which was extremely dangerous. Aberforth described her as mostly ‘sweet, and scared, and harmless’, but when she was upset or angry, magic would explode out of her and she would become ‘strange and dangerous’.""

Where have we heard something like this before? The Harry Potter Wiki says about Obscurials: 

""When a magical child is forced to repress their talent through physical or psychological abuse, they develop a parasitical magical force inside of them called Obscurus, resulting from their strong emotions of distress.

An Obscurial may lose control when they reach their emotional and mental breaking point, releasing their Obscurus as an invisible (or nearly invisible) destructive wind. In extreme cases, they may physically transform into an Obscurus.""

This all but confirms that Ariana Dumbledore was an Obscurial just like Credence Barebone. But why would that mean that they are the same being?

Well, we saw in FB#1 that it is possible to preserve an Obscurus even after the death of its host, as Newt did. Ariana Dumbledore eventually died in the middle of a duel between Albus, Aberforth, and Grindelwald. ""‘…I pulled out my wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother’s best friend – and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us were duelling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn’t stand it –’  
The colour was draining from Aberforth’s face as though he had suffered a mortal wound.  
‘– and I think she wanted to help, but she didn’t really know what she was doing, and I don’t know which of us did it, it could have been any of us – and she was dead.’""  
*Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*

But this still doesn't hold any hints towards Credence. Except it does. Grindelwald reveals at the end of CoG that Credence is ""Aurelius Dumbledore"". He could be outright lying to Credence (and the audience) in order to use him to his own ends! This is where the seemingly random plot elements all over CoG come in.

The prophecy quoted throughout CoG, made by a wizard named Tycho Dodonnus, reads thus:

""A son cruelly banished

Despair of the daughter

Return, Great Avenger

With wings from the water""

This is thought to refer to Corvus Lestrange, but it is revealed that he actually dies in the boat crash, with Credence leaving on the lifeboat in his place, rescued by Leta. So Credence would have died in the water, if not saved by Lestrange, who it is made annoyingly clear to us has the family symbol of a raven, which has wings. ""Return, Great Avenger With wings from the water.""

How did Ariana die? After Aberforth confronting Albus about abandoning them after their mother's death. ""‘I resented it, Harry.’  
Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking, now, over the top of Harry’s head, into the distance.  
‘I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory.  
‘Do not misunderstand me,’ he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again. ‘I loved them. I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine.  
‘So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then, of course, he came …’""

*Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*

After Aberforth's confrontation, the duel began shortly, resulting in Ariana's death.

""A son cruelly banished

Despair of the daughter

Return, Great Avenger

With wings from the water.""

&amp;#x200B;

This is my favorite of many Tycho Dodonnus theories. Let me know in the comments if you want to hear my others!How the predictions of Tycho Doddonus relate to Credence's identity."
0,"So, rewatching CoG, something catched my attention. When Travers visits Dumbledore at Hogwarts, he says:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*TRAVERS*  
&gt;  
&gt;*There’s a rumor this prediction refers to the Obscurial. They say that Grindelwald wants—*  
&gt;  
&gt;*DUMBLEDORE*  
&gt;  
&gt;*—a highborn henchman. I’ve heard the rumor.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*TRAVERS*  
&gt;  
&gt;*And yet Scamander appears wherever the Obscurial goes, to protect him.* ***Meanwhile you have built up quite a little network of international contacts—***  
&gt;  
&gt;*DUMBLEDORE*  
&gt;  
&gt;*(quiet, steely)*  
&gt;  
&gt;***However long you keep me and my friends under surveillance, you’re not going to discover plots against you, Travers, because we want the same thing: the defeat of Grindelwald.*** *But I warn you, your policies of suppression and violence are pushing supporters into his arms—*

&amp;#x200B;

So, this means the Ministry already knows Dumbledore is up to unite a network of international contacts to defeat Grindelwald. And where else can you put your contacts, or as Dumbledores says, his friends to have quick access to all of them? In a magical book of portraits. Yup, the same Flamel's has in his cupboard, to contact Eulalie Hicks. In that scene, the things goes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*FLAMEL shuffles back into his studio and opens a cupboard. We glimpse glass vials, tubes, and the glowing Philosopher’s Stone. He heaves from a shelf a padlocked book embossed with a phoenix. He touches the padlock and it springs open.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*CLOSE ON THE BOOK as he flicks through it.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Each page holds a photograph captioned with a name. FLAMEL turns the pages, but the subjects of all the pictures are missing.*  
&gt;  
&gt;FLAMEL  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh dear—  
&gt;  
&gt;*DUMBLEDORE’S portrait is blank.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*FLAMEL flicks open another page. EULALIE HICKS, a young American professor at Ilvermorny, looks around, worried.*  
&gt;  
&gt;EULALIE  
&gt;  
&gt;What’s happening?  
&gt;  
&gt;FLAMEL  
&gt;  
&gt;**Exactly what he said would happen. Grindelwald rallies tonight at the cemetery, and there will be death!**

&amp;#x200B;

Exactly what *he* said would happen. He referes Dumbledore. And exactly what Dumbledore tells Thesseus at Howgarts:

&gt;DUMBLEDORE  
&gt;  
&gt;Theseus.  
&gt;  
&gt;*THESEUS looks back.*  
&gt;  
&gt;DUMBLEDORE  
&gt;  
&gt;Theseus, **if Grindelwald calls a rally, don’t try and break it up. Don’t let Travers send you in there. If you ever trusted me—**

&amp;#x200B;

So after this, it's ok to assume that:

* The network of international contacts is not a secret organization. The ministry knows about it, and its plans. 
* Somehow, Dumbledore knew in advance Grindelwald's plans at Paris, and warned the Network and Thesseus. How he knew, no idea. 
* Also somehow, Dumbledore knows that Credence was at Paris trying to trace his real family. Dumbledore's plan is to replace that only friend the obcurus is with a real brother or sister, because he is in danger for himself or others. As he says, we may not know who he is yet, but he needs to be found.

&amp;#x200B;

So, maybe you already knew all of this but I came together today to me.

What do you guys think? Any notes or suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

Ps: About the book on the ship, I was a firmly believer that the book was the same as Flamel's, and the woman could be related to that group of people, buuuut^(sorry about this) it seems not to be, [check it for yourself.]( I mean, it's similar or a previous version, but it's they are not *the exactly the same book.*Dumbledore's network of international contacts"

There are Hogwarts students milling about chatting, setting up picnics, and just all around enjoying the beautiful day. Friends are laughing and couples are snogging. And then, all of a sudden the giant squid blasts out of the lake with none other than Newt Scamander riding on it's back.

WOOO HOOO! HUFFLEPUFF RULES!

They land back in the water with a gigantic splash, spraying the students and couples snogging on shore like one of those roller coaster water rides.

0,"Just a thought I was having. I know this series was written after Harry Potter, but after putting so much care into crafting Newt into someone who is very kind, compassionate, and righteous (in Dumbledore's words: you do not seek power, you simply ask ""is a thing right?"") , it seems almost uncharacteristic for Newt to not support in the stand against Voldemort too. I mean, he couldn't have been THAT old considering Professor Slughorn was also involved and was a character from around Newt's time iirc.

It occurred to me that if Theseus were to die due to one of Dumbledore's plans, that could estrange Newt from Dumbledore in a way that makes him reluctant to involve himself in any of Dumbledore's future endeavours.  I mention Theseus because we have so little information about him and that could either mean he's died or it could mean JKR just hasn't shared information with us, I'm hoping it's the latter :"")

When FB3 comes out (hopefully next year) we’d be more than half way done with the films so WHEN EXACTLY will we be seeing some time jumps?? We *know* the story of the movies will span 19 years but apparently the third one has the same cast? are we really spending another film around 1927-1928?

if so, maybe we’ll get a time jump by the ending of FB3 (somehow like Avengers Endgame i suppose) but i think it’d be cool if they cast older actors for the same characters for films 4 and 5 (as in The Crown)

also i hope when this time jump happens we suddenly stop following Newt’s arc because I do not think the 2 films have given us much reasons to care about the character *that* much. Maybe an older Credence could be the main character, or an older Albus but not as old as in Harry Potter.Fantastic Beasts future"
0,"A son cruelly banished:
Newt was expelled from Hogwarts, with Dumbledore strongly arguing against it.

Despair of the daughter:
This doesn’t mean the son causes the despair, but the events surrounding the son, the banishing, causes the despair. The expelling of Newt causes Leta great despair as he's both her friend and is expelled due to taking the blame for something she did.

Return great avenger:
Newt avenges Leta's death, at the hands of Grindelwald.

With wings from the water:
This I don't know, but it is obviously to be revealed.
But on Twitter a while ago, Rowling was asked what Newt's Patronus is or if it's a spoiler to reveal, and Rowling responsed by saying it's a big spoiler. It could be that his Patronus is something to do with this last line.My prediction for whom the prophecy refers to"

0,"Pretty much the title.  After watching Crimes many times and ready what the actors have to say I have a feeling Crimes is a part 1 and FB3 is the part 2.

First off, and more obviously, Crimes finished off with a cliffhanger, the only other Wazarding World movie to have a cliffhanger to that level of anticipation for part 2 is HP7 p1.  The pretty much finish the movie on a big cliffhanger.

From what Victoria Yeates said: It’s really well written, the characters are really beautifully developed. It’s got a lot of depth to it.
Source Mugglenet instagram live

Dan Fogler pretty much says the same about the character developement in FB3.

It hasnt been officially confirmed, but many characters from Crimes are expected to return in 3, like Nagini, possibly Flamel - who from theories on how Aurelius can exist is very important -, Spielman could also return since he is german and Berlin is one of the locations we will see in 3.

If many characters who lacked a complete arc return in this one and finish - or continue expanding - their arc, I think the feel of 3 will be very much a part 2 to Crimes' part 1.

With the mixed idea of finishing the movie on a cliffhanger and introducing a very debated identity for Credence I think calling it a part 1 would have helped people understand these decissions.

Of course I havent read the script nor do I know anything other than what the actors have revealed and so do not know if 3 will be conceived like a part 2.  Im just saying I understand Crimes to be more of a part 1 than a complete story, with all the character set ups it gave us.

0,"These are some of my theories, let me know which ones of them do you think has a better probability of happening :
 So the basic idea is Albus Dumbledore gets the wand in a one on one battle with Grindelwald but what if that's not the case 

Theory 1:
What if Arulius decides he wants to kill everyone Grindelwal rindelwal and Ablus Dumbledore... And manages to win against Grindelwal and lose against Albus Dumbledore.
But Albus Dumbledore doesn't kill him bcz obviously he is his Brother

Theory 2:
Or let's add Newt to the picture... He (Newt) manages to win against Grindelwal but doesn't want to hurt Arulius... So Arulius wins ... Then in anger Arulius goes against Albus Dumbledore but Albus Dumbledore wins with Newt's help coz obviously Arulius has the elder wand... And then Albus Dumbledore ends up getting the elder wand bcz Newt doesn't want it or one of his magical creatures helped and technically Albus Dumbledore got the last blow... And finally gets the wand

Theory 3:
Or...! The wand chooses the wizard right... And the wand chose Albus Dumbledore bcz he is the most powerful wizard... And Newt just doesn't seek power and its in the nature of the elder wand to be powerful

Theory 4:
Or! Everything happens according to the first theory but Arulius being new to the Wizarding World does not know (After killing /winning against Grindelwald) that the want belongs to him and then preceeds to kill Albus with his regular wand and looses. Making Elder wand to chose Albus Dumbledore as his master.


Do let me know what you think.So how exactly does dumbledore get the elder want."

I have no idea what's going on here. It seems recent as he mentions Corona Virus. He's making no sense whatsover. Talking some noncence about religion and space and something and it seems like violent outbursts. And his facial expression is just downright scary.

He doesn't sound drunk. Is he high on the wrong drugs? 

Frankly i like him less and less with his 'better then everone else' attitude. I really liked him in interviews at the time of FB1. In FB2 interviews he always seems to need all the attention of other cast members. I remember the interview he gave with Claudia Kim. Like a 4 year old constantly trying to get the attention. He was either talking or acting as a clown the moment Claudia Kim had to awnser a question. Very disrespectfull in my opinion. I still cringe when i see FB cast photo's and every cast member is acting normal and he's in some clown costume pretty much ruining the picture. Doesn't he consider other people's feelings?

Even his ' fight for gender equality' seems to be 'Hey look at me wearing strange stuff. Look at me look at me! Using a currently very sensitive subject rather as a way to get attention without actually really caring about the subject.

I mean. He seems to have a very loud opinion on all the things other people are doing wrong in his view. But other then dressing up with and calling people names what has he done? Besides fysically asaulting a woman while beeing drunk?

I dunno. I must admit i'm really starting to dislike him. A violent drunk/drug addiction so young... It does not bode well for him. He does not seem to be able to handle the fame of beeing an actor. He is a very attractive man i won't deny. And a good actor. But it doesn't seem it betters him as a person. I hope he recieves some help soon.

0,"Hello everyone first time posting here but long time reader. I would have posted this in the megathread but the last message in there is one year old.

Anyway, as the title may indicate, my favorite character from FB is Grindelwald (portrayed by Johnny Depp) When reading the books I was more than slightly intrigued by him and wanted to know more about his story with Dumbledore. Then the first film came, I enjoyed it, foremost because of Newt. And then, at the end ~~a wild Grindelwald appears!~~    Grindelwald true face is revealed. I was enthralled on the spot. I didn't even know it was Johnny Depp at first. And come the next movie and my love for that character is cemented. He is so complexe, so fascinating, deliciously bad yet able to be charming and seductive. I think Depp played him to the perfection, the thing he can express with his eyes, the looks on his face, the way he move (what with the Maestro hands move in the rally scene)

But the thing is I feel bad for loving him, now. Because I read everywhere I go to discuss the movies (and books) that he is basically Hitler version in the magical world. I think I'm dumb but It never occurred to me before. For me he was that dark mage who was dangerous and dark but also Dumbledore best *""more than brother"".* So now I feel ashamed to like Grindelwald and enjoy his evilness because, well, it would be like liking Hitler himself. I'm torn. I want to enjoy that character and keep loving him. You know I really hate when authors use real people as an inspiration, especially controversial or downright evil one. I read also to escape, to evade the real world, sometime, and I don't like it when real life intrude. It's stupid, I know.

And,  if you have to compare with real people, then Grindelwald is more akin to Che Guevara than Hitler, for me. Grindelwald is a revolutionary and a warrior. Hitler was a politician.

Anyway, I just needed to vent a bit, sorry if I annoyed anyone with my rant.What if I really love Grindelwald?"
0,"Right. I’m just so god damn frustrated when I logged on to twitter today. And now that Rowling has faced major backlash for believing in actual biology and stating that two sexes still exist. There’s nothing wrong with acknowledging that two genders exist. 

I for one doesn’t really care about what trans or whatever they’re called nowadays. They can identify as what ever they want. But when they try to openly cancel people and MOVIES, god damn movies about wizards and witches. Then I’m getting really mad. 

I’m just so frustrated at many things. These selfish egos on twitter thinking they can crash a billion franchise with their stupid Woke agenda. And listen, if you don’t like the series, don’t f*cking watch them! But do not think your entitled to destroy a franchise because you’re a sjw or your a member of the lgbt community. You will not destroy others enjoyment of these movies. You’re the problem! 

And you think you and your trans community will make me respect you more when you threat, abuse and acts immature? Not a fucking chance, it’s the exact opposite. I’ve lost all respect. Because you’re selfish entitled morons. And do not think the idea of taking down a franchise because you don’t agree with a woman views and opinion. Then I’m gonna be real pissed. 

And there’s people out there that has issues with their life, but see movies and entertainment as a getaway and a massive important piece to their life. And I’m one of those people. I have my issues with depression, but I see the Wizarding World as a way out. Movies and books that I can feel happy. And I and many people are invested into the story and are looking forward to the next 3 movies. 

But unfortunately these SJW woke morons will do everything to stop it because they’re selfish pricks who think that the worlds surrounds around them! These are toxic and dangerous to cinema. And they need to be stopped. As the politics in movies. 

Anyway, I’m just so annoyed with these people. And it looks like a thing that I was generally looking forward to they’re destroyed. Had enough of your bullshit, fuck you and your woke selfish egos. 

So thank you for destroying a thing I was generally excited about because you didn’t agree with one woman’s opinion. I’m pissed, disappointed and I’ve lost all respect for the trans community.(Rant) The Woke SJW are destroying cinema and possible future FB instalments. They will ruin Hollywood and Blockbusters."

0,"After CoG's box office performance, there was a report that Warner was sort of let down and wanted to revamp the film series. In many ways, I think that the reason was not within the film itself, but with people upset about Depp's casting and the lack of more intimate Grindelwald and Dumbledore scenes as some kind of LGBT representation. After JKR last tweets and the backlash she's received, do you think that it might lead to a boycott and subsequent cancelation of the next movies?

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who replied. Here's hoping we get three more amazing films.Would the series get canceled?"
0,"Considering the series is going to increasingly focus on Dumbledore vs Grindelwald, it'd be surprising if we don't meet Aberforth in the following movies. The Dumbledore brothers fought against Voldemort together, so it wouldn't surprise me if they help each other in taking down Grindelwald.

0,"Hi there :)

Hope my obsession with this character will be a litte calm after this post :) (... we'll see about that, it's my favourite mystery for the series at the moment ^^ )

Enjoy :)


1. Let’s start small - he grew up in America, yet his actor, Kevin Gurthire, is scottish … when possible so far, people were chosen specifically for some roles, and I feel like, especially with a possible casting pool as wide as the american, they wouldn’t cast someone from Britian just like that …


2. Apart from sharing more than enough visuals with Sabine Crossen (playing Clarisse Lestrange, Corvus Vs mother) to seem like her son, he is the almost spitting younger image of **Keith Chanter** aka Corvus IV, facial features, eye colour, everything - we’ll get to a possible new naming for him in relation to his parents by the end. Plus, while Sabine Crossen often changes her hair colour, in her one appearence in this movie, it’s definitly his. 


3. He would be the right age - born around **1901**, Corvus V should be around **25/26**, and though he’s already in a high position at the MACUSA when we meet him, he seems by far young enough, especially in TCOG


4. In the beginning scene of the movie, we see him almost drown during Grindelwald’s escape, before being rescued by latter - I think he very well may have in the past once realizing the other baby that would become Credence was safe (and before he became convinced he was a squib since he repressed his magic and couldn’t be the Obscurial either due to his age). It would make sense for him to bring two potential (maybe all he thinks there are) “Great Avengers” to his side - and he may need Corvus in relation to the Lestranges, maybe due to being of the blood of a family of the Sacred 28, maybe due to being entitled to their inheritance - or….


5. … to have acess to **specific tools** in their possession? Now we get to the biggest hint for this theory:
Although he is a wanted man by this point (since Spielman survived Grindelwald's escape) Abernathy accompanies Rosier to the French ministry of magic, where they **retrieve the Lestrange family tree** - and he hands her a bundle to carry it, implying that he’s the one who will take it from the shelf, maybe due to a protective spell that only allows family members to touch it - this thought is furthered by the fact that when we see the box again, in the Lestrange family crypt, he is seen looking right to the spot where it is found later on, in a very significant shot … you could even add that, when Leta retrieves it, she summons it directly, maybe to avoid anyone else in the room touching it. Credence was there to look for his past, and she was there, being the only one knowing the truth (which Grindelwald knew about as well, either over a vision or, exactly, since he was there that day and kept track of them both).


6. Small hint maybe, but we never learn his first name, though he’s there from the first movie on … JK likes to hide meaning in names, and Abernathy on its’ own is originally from Scotland, aka Gurthires’ home country …
I wonder if his first name, maybe one Grindelwald gave his adoptive parents, is some variation of Corvus .. maybe a little more hidden like “Bertram” (*bright raven*, hence the white one on the dark veil towards the finale, maybe even in relation to his mother Clarisse (*bright*).
Also, JK has used this name before for a fellow student of the Marauders (Bertram Aubrey) :)


7. Last small one: when Grindelwald conjures him a new tounge, it’s split  🐍 
It may be a special reward for his services that grants him the ability to speak and understand parsel - and another hint since later on, Leta is seen being in Slytherin, the House most Lestranges went to, though she’s not like them - maybe another hint to Abernathy not being entirely bad either? Adding this to my notes for sure :D

... 

Could this be one of the reasons why we see him in this movie so often? Did wonder about that too ... also, how would it be for (a hopefully alive) Leta to find out that her brother is alive?
Thank you very much for reading :)

Edit: big thanks to *thebosd* below pointing out that Yusuf still being alive after ""Corvus"" ' death could be a hint - counting this in as **Nr. 8** (makes sense, he may believe that there's something or someone unknown to him Corvus IV loved, something he may still be looking for in FB3 - my personal hope is that he kills Corvus IV himself) 

Plus, I recently came across a possible **Nr. 9**

* Wand Leta Lestrange - 

* Wand Mr. Abernathy - 

* Wand Yusuf Kama - 

Wands are usually personalized onto the character, and hold specifics about them - and there isn't really a reason why these would **all* have this black spiraling-down element to them ... unless it's connected to the spiral we see the baby in Leta's vision sink down - it could be interpreted as this incident being a big part of her life, and his entire/the start of it - and the rest of her wand is black, while his is light - aka he had a better life afterwards ... Yusuf's life was alright too, but the unbreakable vow connected to Corvus was always there ... 

And these aren't just merchandise items, they're used in the films. Also, looking at the hints we already got ... is it so far away that there would be another indication?

Edit 2: 

*misterXB* mentioned magic bubbles trailing from the baby, which are mentioned in the script ... may be a form of unintentional help signal made by his magic, much like sending sparks into the sky - kids in the wizarding world are known to often use their magic subconciously when stressed, especially when in danger ... and many babies are able to hold their breath and lower their bodies' oxygen use when under water for a limited time - we only see Corvus V for a few seconds ... 

Also, wondered today - Abernathy's motive for joining Grindelwald is unclear in the movie, and he seems very insecure - could be power or the chance to win Queenie's heart, as G may have seen she'd join under the upcoming circumstances... but it would work just as well if Grindelwald revealed to him post FB1 that he owes him his life ... being in somebody's debt has been a topic in HP before, even in the first Fantastic Beasts movie when the MACUSA didn't press charges against Newt when he obliviated the city for them ... and offering him power, a purpose/safe place in the new world and his true identity simply in exchange for ""helping"" someone who saved his life anyway sounds like something that would work

Edit 3: 

The story of Leta loosing her brother and feeling guilty all her life ended surprisingly unresolved - if there is any reason why Corvus V should live, it's that Leta (who's death I doubt strongly) deserves to get both the relief from the guilt that's been haunting her all her life, and one person from her own family that can be her friend (especially since he wasn't raised by them) ... getting to know her could also be a first thing to turn him away from the dark side ... if he really is Corvus, Leta deserves to find and reunite with him - it would be an incredibly wholesome conclusion :)

Edit 4 : Someone named ""McDuff"" helps him place the family tree the next time we see him, and this character has also been shown to walk towards the hideout apartment with him ... I'm still trying to figure out how he could fit into the Lestrange family tree, but wouldn't put past that he may be the member of a line that married into the family, plus pure-blood and thus considered an alliance, like, possibly, Rosier too when they retrieved the family tree the first time (Minette Rosier was the wife of Corvus II, her relation to Vinda is yet unknown).

Or simply, that the family tree's magic ""turns off"", as long as a member of the line touches it = there's no indication of theft7 hints to Abernathy being the lost Corvus V (Theory) (Spoilers)"

The last scene obviously shows Grindelwald telling Credence he's actually Aurelius Dumbledore, implying Albus is his brother. As much as I like the plot twist, it can't be true. When I read through Harry Potter and the deathly hallows to find out whether Kendra Dumbledore died in that sinking ship, I found out that wasn't the case, and on some Fandom pages I discovered that was his aunt. But what I also found was the birthdate of Credence/Aurelius and the death date of Kendra. Kendra died in 1899 because of Ariana(who I suspect to be an obscurus) and Credence seems to be born in 1901. This would of course make it impossible for Credence to be a Dumbledore, probably also because Percival Dumbledore was either in Azkaban or already dead.

So, I decided to lay down some predictions I have for the third installment in the series. I’m in no way a leaker and these are all predictions, so in the unlikely event that any of this ends up true, it’ll just be a coincidence.

Feel free to join in with your own predictions or wishlist or whatever in the comments, this is an open discussion. Theories and concepts are also welcome in the comments.

1. Newt’s conclusion.
Ever since the release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them, we have known that eventually, Newt will be sidelined to make room for the more important story of the duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald.
I believe that FB3 will conclude Newt’s arc, and this includes the arcs of any character related to his side of the story, like Jacob and the Goldstein sisters. I doubt that we won’t ever see him again, maybe he returns in 5.

2. Aurelius rises.
Grindelwald give Credence an identity at the end of CoG. Fake or not, Aurelius Dumbledore will be the character we follow throughout FB3 and into 4 and 5. I believe that he’ll be the focus of the third movie.
Now, he was an important character in the first two movies too, but he was a passive character. He reacted to the things around him instead of taking action. In the third installment, he will be the main character. 

3. The Endgame.
Among other things, CoG lacked a climactic final battle. Instead, we got a more passive, silent conclusion with the Ring of Fire and the Dragons. I think that FB3 will include a battle similar to FBAWTFT. 
This battle will also be paralleled in the final installment, with 4 having a quieter ending similar to CoG. FB3 will set up the endgame of this series, with 4 and 5 possibly being two parts of the same story.

TLDR: Newt’s story ends, Aurelius is the main character, Climactic battle in the end instead of passive fight.Fantastic Beasts 3: Predictions"
0,"So, the third Fantastic Beasts movie was supposed to be filmed this year, but like most movies that were due to be filmed in 2020, it was delayed. Unlike most delayed movies, FB3 was delayed due to a major change made to the script. 

We know that Warner Bros is making a greater effort into the third installment due to poor reception to The Crimes of Grindelwald. This is probably why they wanted to change the script, so that the end result was a better movie and they could “revive” the franchise in a sense. 

Now my question is, what do you think the change (or changes) made to the script is?Change to Fantastic Beasts 3"

0,"Grindelwald has two different endings that we know of. According to the books, he died laughing at Voldemort's face and protecting the Elder Wand. According to the Harry Potter films, he helped Voldemort and is left alive.

Though they make little change to the Harry Potter plot, they give us very different personalities for Grindelwald:

The book version shows us that Grindelwald is more nuanced than an evil villain. He dies both protecting the tomb of his old friend -highlighting that he may still harbour some kind of affection for Dumbledore- and slowing the rise of Voldemort. Though we do not know his motivations for sure, Dumbledore hints that Grindelwald showed remorse in the last years.

The film version is the opposite. He was a dark mage, now happily helping another dark mage follow the same path he once did. Zero evolution of the character.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm wondering which version is supposed to be canon in the Fantastic Beasts universe?

From Grave's monologue in FBAWTFT I could imagine the book version. Graves/Grindelwald (based on his monologue to the aurors) seemed like a man driven by his ideas of wizards freedom, even if it meant getting rid of opponents for their accomplishment. With his defeat and imprisonment, I could imagine him becoming humble enough to reconsider wizards' superiority over muggles and realize how all those deaths were not worth it.

After the second film I'm not so sure. What he tells his followers, and the baby scene seem to indicate that his speeches are just a cover to basic racism towards muggles, which would make him really similar to Voldemort. I have more difficulties imagining that kind of personality evolving into the book version.

&amp;#x200B;

0,"My thoughts regarding TYCHO DODONUS PREDICTION:  ""Return"" is plural and refers to both the son and the ""Desperation of the daughter"". The only comma is found after return, which ends the sentence. ""Great Avenger"" is singular and could not have been placed without context. So ""With wings from the water"" is related to ""Great Avenger"" and the verb ""returns"" (singular) can be implied. 

So, the prediction could be written like this: 
""A son cruelly banished [and the] despair of the daughter return. [The] great avenger
[returns] with wings from the water.""

It should be noted that there is not written ""the desperate daughter"" but ""the desperation of the daughter"". Desperation is intended as a noun, not as an adjective. We know that an obscurus is an entity that represents despair. 

Can the Great Avenger be the Great Albus Dumbledore? Also, ""Wings"" can refer to a phoenix and ""water"" to the phoenix's tears

The beauty of cinema is that we can all like different things, but simply branding any criticism of COG as ""you're just a complaining hater, COG doesn't deserve this hatred"" just contributes to an unhealthy echo-chamber mindset.

From interviews and BTS footage we do see that much of JKR's original script was cut so I do wonder what was edited out and if this might have been a mistake. It might have helped silence some criticisms of the movie. 

Although this movie does have many characters, I found it only made the movie richer and more interesting. Each character's story gave the Wizarding World more depth. It gave the world a little more life.

The orphan Credence who goes on a journey to find his identity because he thinks it will give him some meaning and answers. It only leads to more questions and inevitably more pain. """"He knows what you were born, not who you are."" [to Credence] - Nagini

Nagini, on the other hand, is probably the most tragic of them all clinging onto the last threads of humanity she has left as she starts her transition and loses herself to a monster. 

Dumbledore: living with his guilt, regret and the horrible shame of his past choices and his sister's tragic death. He is horrified by what the boy he fell in love with has become yet he cant shake the guilt and shame that his time with Gellert will always be nostagic. It was the only time he felt fully understood. He could finally share the burden of knowledge he had with someone who could intellectually understand it. 


Grindelwald manipulates every single one of them and pits them against eachother to get what he wants: Credence and Queenie. Its masterful and scary at the same time. 

I acknowledge that this isn't a perfect film, it's format is unique and unlike other blockbusters so I understand that those not used to this might not take to it.

 However, I think it's aesthetically beautiful with a fascinating array of characters that showcase the human condition in all its terrible and brilliant glory.

0,"So, I've been theorizing about what might happen next in the next installment of the series and I'd like to know your thoughts about it. Feel free to comment them.

1 - Newt in Brazil.
We know that Rio de Janeiro will be a setting (main setting?) of the third film. I think it'll be related to finding a way to break the blood pact. I don't know who he'd be with on it. I read somewhere that Warner executives wanted more Hogwarts scenes so I think Dumbledore would be there. Also, Theseus might be busy with his auror duties. As for Jacob and Tina...

2 - Queenie
I think there'll be a storyline of ""rescuing"" Queenie and that would be Tina and Jacob story in FB3. Queenie's powers are always depicted as extremely powerful and uncontrollable, could it be that she will enter Grindelwald's mind and discover something?

3 - The Order of the Phoenix?
I really don't think Nicolas Flamel is done in this series. That book of his hinted in some sort of contact list in the likes of the Order of the Phoenix and I think it'll play out broadly since, as Dan Fogler mentioned in a interview, there's a war brewing.

4 - Eulalie Hicks
I really expect this character to be one of my favorites. The way J.K. talked about her ""true glory"" makes me wonder she'll be quite crucial in the plot of this film. I don't know if we get to see her in Ilvermorny, but I think FB4 will deal with some typenof reborning of the Second Salemer that might take us back to USA.

5 - Aurelius Dumbledore
Whatever the answer to this puzzle is, I believe is something to be found out in this film and the two next will deal with its consequences. I don't think it'll be as simple (and lame) as Grindelwald was just lying. And as, there is a war coming, I think Grindelwald will manipulate Credence into some sort of terrorist attack.

So, I'd lile to know what you guys think of these ideas. How (and if) you'd like to see some of them playing out.Predictions for Fantastic Beasts 3"

0,"If you don't know who the Sacred Twenty-Eight are: It is a list of 28 pureblood families and was published in the early 1930s by Cantankerus Nott. With Grindelwald's affiliation to Purebloods and the perfect timeline for the Fantastic Beasts movies  (1926-1945) it is possible that the publishing of this list will get some background and connections to Grindelwald's rise.

0,"**Well, this is my first post here on reddit and I wanted to put some topics up for discussion.**

&amp;#x200B;

We all know that *You-Know-Who* feared death and sought immortality at any cost. Because of that, he created horcruxes and thus managed to fragment his soul so that he could live without worrying about leaving for the world of the dead.

In Fantastic Beasts we're aware of Nagini's previous existence as a woman subject to a bloody curse (maledictus) and, I believe, we can say that the Nagini woman is the Nagini snake that the Dark Lord later chose as his horcrux.

If we consider that the theory that Aurelius Dumbledore is an attempt to restore Ariana through the Philosopher's Stone is true, we have the following problem in the events of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone:

Lord Voldemort was not looking for the Stone to turn any metal into gold or to obtain the Elixir of Life (because at that point he already had horcruxes, so immortality, even without a body to house part of his soul). That implies two of the three goals of alchemy. The last objective would be the creation of artificial man (homunculus), explaining the existence of Aurelius.

In Albus' chocolate frog card, it's said that he and Nicolas Flamel worked together on some alchemy project. We can disregard that their work was the creation of the Elixir of Life, because Flamel was about 665 years old at his death and, if Aurelius' theory is confirmed, it is assumed that their work occurred when the alchemist had around 575 years old (which is really unlikely to live without an elixir).

I don't really know if Nicolas managed to turn any metal into pure gold (we see that the conditions of his house are pretty humble) , so let's focus on the third goal: **creating a homunculus**. This is what I think Voldemort really sought with the Philosopher's Stone.

Nagini is present at FB2 events and we do not know the exact moment when she goes to Albania, and whether she goes as a snake or as a woman (correct me if I am wrong). It is possible that Voldemort, estimating that Albus' work with Flamel was precisely to use the Philosopher's Stone to create a homunculus, tried to repeat the process to restore his own body. And the key point of this is Nagini.

Nagini, at some point, will know the true story of Credence / Aurelius. From there we came up with two ideas: a) knowing Voldemort's goals, Nagini sought out the wizard motivated by, perhaps, revenge, if she feels wronged by her condition and finds her safe spot; b) Voldemort went after Nagini knowing about his past relationship with Credence and, either by persuasion or an Imperius Curse, managed to seduce Nagini to join him.

&amp;#x200B;

The discussion points of the topic are (if all theories are correct):

a) The exact moment that Nagini ended up in Albania and if she went there as a woman or as a snake (Voldemort is indifferent because he could talk to snakes and communicate with Nagini anyway);

b) Nagini sought revenge for being cursed and allied herself with Voldemort because their plans matched;

c) Voldemort sees in Nagini a possibility to dominate the world and for this reason he seduced her to join him.

d) What happend to Nagini during the FB events?

What do you think? Makes sense?Why Voldemort chose Nagini... (HP and FB theory)"

At the end of The Crimes of Grindelwald, he tells Creedence he's a Dumbledore. My theory is that since Grindelwald can see the future (as he proved projecting WWII moments a few scenes earlier in the arena), he got that information from the future. Or did he get it from something in the past that I haven't noticed?

Besides, this is supposed to be a cliffhanger, right? The next movie must solve the issue anyway. I hope they'll show how the Lestranges and Grindelwald were connected. But still, since Credence is a random boy with no family name randomly chosen by a little girl while everybody were busy trying to not sink into the ocean, how could Grindelwald know?[SPOILER FB2] How could Grindelwald..."

The Rebellion of the Death Eaters (1) 

*Opening* In Micheal Gambons voice “Imagine that Voldemort's powerful now. You don't know who his supporters are, you don't know who's working for him and who isn't; you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves. You're scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends. Every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing... The Ministry of Magic's in disarray, they don't know what to do, they're trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too. Terror everywhere... panic... confusion... that's how it used to be”. 

It was in this charged climate that in 1970, Voldemort revealed himself openly, proclaimomg himself the Dark Lord, and started to commit extreme acts of terrorism around Europe. With his army of dark wizards and dark creatures at his command, Voldemort launched an assault against the British Ministry Of Magic with the intention of toppling it and creating a new world order run by pure-bloods, with Muggle-borns either killed en masse or kept in utter bondage, and Lord Voldemort himself as an immortal leader, though likely ruling from behind the scenes. To achieve these ends, the Death Eaters and their allies (including the particularly destructive Giants) began openly carrying out attacks on Muggles for sport and to sow chaos. Cleaning up these attacks, healing survivors, modifying memories, searching for the perpetrators, and attempting to prevent future attacks occupied more and more of the Ministry's time and attention. As their confidence grew, the Death Eaters began targeting Muggle-born and blood traitor witches and wizards as well, torturing and sometimes killing their victims, which shocked wizarding society. Other ""inferior"" magical beings such as house-elves (who were treated like vermin) and Goblins (a family of which was slaughtered) also suffered under their reign of terror. To inspire yet more terror, the Death Eaters would cast the Dark Mark in the sky over every house or scene that they killed at.

Many Death Eaters also managed to secretly gain strategic positions within the Ministry Of Magic itself. They then used blackmail and the Imperius Curse to expand their influence and destabilise the government from within, which was desperately trying to keep order and continue to maintain secrecy from the Muggle world. Augustus Rookwood, an Unspeakable in the Department of Mysteries, managed to set up a particularly successful-secret network of espionage within the Ministry. Minister Jenkins was ill-prepared to lead during wartime, and it seemed that the Ministry was incapable of gaining the upper hand. Voldemort himself personally killed hundreds of wizards, though he tended to only fight those he considered worthy of his attention or too powerful for his followers to defeat. In these encounter, he displayed his extraordinary abilities, many of which were thought impossible, and he very quickly earned the reputation of the most powerful and dangerous dark wizard of all time, surpassing even Gellért Grindelwald.

The Order of the Phoenix (2)

In response to the growing threat of Lord Voldemort and his minions, Albus Dumbledore formed the Order Of The Phoenix in 1971; to take the fight directly to the Death Eaters. Though the Ministry officially viewed the Order as a renegade outfit, a number of powerful Ministry officials (such as Elphias Doge and Dedalus Diggle; and the famous Aurors Alastor Moody and Frank Longbottom and Alice Longbottom) joined instantly to participate in more secretive, sudden assaults to crush the dark rebellion.[12] When Dumbledore helped black market trader Mundungus Fletcher out of trouble, he joined the Order and, due to his extensive knowledge of the criminal underworld, proved very useful. To allow members of the Order to covertly communicate with each other, Dumbledore invented a method of sending messages via the Patronus Charm.

Despite the Order’s best efforts, Voldemort continued to grow in magical power and influence, and his attacks, whether carried out personally or by his Death Eaters, became more frequent and brutal. It was clear that Dumbledore was the only wizard in the world who rivalled Voldemort in ability. The nascent Order of the Phoenix initially had very little success, and many continued to be killed by Voldemort. Terror and chaos gripped the populace of wizarding Britain to the point that many began to fear to speak Voldemort's name. He became widely referred to as ""He Who Must Not Be Named,"" or, less formally, ""You Know Who"" within the first year of his reign. Numerous ordinary witches and wizards (such as Mr. Thomas and Robert McGonagall Jr.) lost their lives, and the Death Eaters frequently cast the Dark Mark over the scenes of their murders. To protect the organisation, Voldemort ensured that Death Eaters did not know the identities of too many of their fellows, and, to society at large, their identities were completely unknown.[13] Increasing the confusion and paranoia even further, Voldemort placed many dozens of innocent victims under the Imperius Curse simulaniously, and forced them to carry out his orders. Even friends and family members were not above suspicion of one another.

In 1975, Eugenia Jenkins was ousted as Minister Of Magic and replaced by Harold Minchum, a hardliner who placed more Dementors around Azkaban.[11] In addition, ruthless Council Of Magical Law Head Judge Bartemius ""Barty"" Crouch Senior rose rapidly through the Ministry's ranks until he also became the Head of the Department Of Magical Law Enforcement. Minchum and Crouch then began to make serious headway, though the anonymous and elusive Death Eaters still retained the advantage.

Albus Dumbledore and the War of the Wands (3)

In 1978, Severus Snape graduated from Hogwarts and entered the ranks of the Death Eaters, joining his schoolmates Evan Rosier, Lucius Malfoy, Bellatrix Lestrange, Sewlyn, Jerome Jugson, Jugson, Regulus Black, Rodolphus Lestrange, Rabastan Lestrange, Thorfinn Rowle, Gibbon, Augustus Rookwood, Igor Karkaroff, Crabbe, Goyle, Travers, and Antonin Dolohov. Likely at Snape's urging, Voldemort attempted to recruit Lily Evans, whose prodigious talents made up for her status as a Muggle-born, along with her blood traitor boyfriend James Potter; and James' childhood friends: Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew. Naturally, they all refused, defying Voldemort for the very first time, and James and Lily were soon married and joined the Order Of The Phoenix along with their other friends. Around this time, James and Sirius, who had been disowned by the House of Black, were pursued by a trio of Death Eaters, though they easily managed to evade them and escape.

Voldemort then gravitated towards several of his younger recruits who were specially magically powerful and fanatically loyal. He took only Severus Snape and Bellatrix Lestrange under his personal wing, sharing with them his personal-secret knowledge of the Dark Arts; and inspiring in Bellatrix a delusional-psychotic attraction bordering on loving obsession, which Voldemort never returned. He also entrusted his diary Horcrux to Lucius Malfoy, with whom he schemed of using to secretly re-open the Chamber of Secrets, for he did not dare attack Hogwarts directly as long as Dumbledore was Headmaster. This did not come to fruition till many years later. Severus Snape, a fellow half-blood with whom he had much in common, quickly became his most valuable servant; even more so than Bellatrix Lestrange, though Voldemort never told her that. Snape was also the only Death Eater, who Voldemort allowed to freely act, unless it was a mission of great importance.

In 1979, Regulus Black, the younger brother Sirius Black, graduated from Hogwarts and joined the Death Eaters. He remained a pure-blood supremacist, but quickly became incredibly disenchanted with the cause's insane and brutal leader. Around this time, Voldemort felt the need to test the defences around his Horcruxes. To make sure Slytherin's locket was secure, he requested the use of Regulus's house-elf Kreacher and then callously left him to die. When Kreacher managed survive and to return home, Regulus deduced that Voldemort had created a Horcrux and attempted to destroy it. This failed and resulted in his violent death at the hands of the Inferi, though he did manage to replace the locket with a fake and entrust the real Horcrux to Kreacher.[14]

Despite being in the midst of a war, life went on for those who had not yet become its victims. Under the leadership of Dumbledore, Hogwarts remained a bastion of elite-supreme magical education and was left totally untouched by the Death Eaters. It was suggested after the war that marriages and births increased significantly during these years, as the future was uncertain.[14] Late in July of 1980, Order members James Potter and Lily Potter had a son, Harry Potter, while Frank Longbottom and Alice Longbottom had Neville Longbottom. At the same time, Death Eaters Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Malfoy had Draco Malfoy, while Crabbe Snr and Goyle Snr also had sons; and Bellatrix Lestrange married Rodolphus Lestrange, though neither of them actually viewed their marriage as legit, only a means of avoiding ending up with anyone less than a pure-blood.

Albus Dumbledore and the Downfall of Voldemort part 1 (4)

In 1980, Minister Minchum was also removed from office due to his failure to end the war and was immediately replaced with Millicent Bagnold.[11] Order member Peter Pettigrew was also secretly initiated as a Death Eater, because of the latter's great fear of Voldemort and the foolish conclusion that nothing could be truly gained by resisting him; and began feeding information on the Order's movements to Voldemort. Members began regarding each other uneasily, and Sirius Black suspected that his friend Remus Lupin, who was frequently undercover among Voldemort's werewolf allies, was a spy.[15] When the entire order gathered for a group photograph in July of 1981, no one suspected the truth.

Shortly afterwards, due to Pettigrew's betrayal, Death Eaters began systematically murdering Order members and the war entered its most desperate phase. Marlene McKinnon was slaughtered alongside her entire family by Travers, Nott, and Mulciber. Edgar Bones, his wife, and their children were murdered by Thorfinn Rowle and Fenrir Greyback. Gideon Prewett and Fabian Prewett both fought bravely but were ultimately killed by Antonin Dolohov, and Dorcas Meadowes was murdered by Voldemort himself. Caradoc Dearborn disappeared and was never found, though he was presumed dead. Benjy Fenwick was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange, Evan Rosier, and Julius Jerome; and so brutally mutilated that only bits of him were recovered.

In response to this brutal onslaught, Barty Crouch Snr, who despised Voldemort, the Death Eaters, and the Dark Arts entirely; issued an edict giving Ministry Aurors full permission to employ the use of the Unforgivable Curses against their enemies. A massive Ministry campaign, spearheaded and led by Alastor Moody, Kingsley Shackelbolt, and Frank Longbottom; ensued, immediately turning the tide of the war against the Death Eaters. They initially focused their efforts on resisting the giants, killing many of them with the Killing Curse, and wiping out entire tribes until they forced the survivors to go into hiding.[12] Finally, the Ministry began to identify and apprehend Death Eaters. Auror and Order member Alastor Moody became legendary for his successes, arresting and capturing Igor Karkaroff along with many other supporters of the Dark Lord, and also killing Evan Rosier when he resisted arrest, although losing a chunk of his nose in the process. Antonin Dolohov also met his capture and imprisonment at the hands of Magical Law Enforcement Squad and Corban Yaxley, one of Voldemort's earliest followers, was captured and sent to Azkaban as well. Still Voldemort himself remained untouchabl, both for his elusiveness, and for his legendary power and skill, which no one but Dumbledore could match.

Albus Dumbledore and the Downfall of Voldemort part 2 (5) 

During the worst days of the war, in late 1980; James and Lily Potter lived in Godric's Hollow, England with their son, Harry. The family had been asked to go into hiding by Professor Dumbledore himself, as they knew they were definitely on Voldemort's radar as hated enemies. James then lent his family heirloom invisibility cloak to Dumbledore, who was curious about its properties. Around this time, Dumbledore met with Sybill Trelawney at the Hog's Head Inn in Hogsmeade regarding the vacant position of Divination teacher. During the interview, Trewlaney entered into a magical trance and made a real prophecy: in which she foretold the futuristic coming of a young wizard who would not only become Voldemort's equal; but would finish The Dark Lord for good, due to this individual having strength, power, courage, will, purity of heart, and most of all: a deep love that would not only surpass those of Lord Voldemort, but of Albus Dumbledore himself.

There were two possible candidates, both born in July of 1980 to members of the Order Of The Phoenix who had thrice defied the Dark Lord: Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom.[12] Severus Snape was also secretly at the inn, and managed to overhear only part of the prophecy before being discovered and thrown out by the inn's keeper, who was secretly Order member Aberforth Dumbledore, Dumbledore's younger brother. Snape then immediately reported what he had heard to Voldemort, who became so fearful and was greatly concerned over the information. Voldemort then immediately assumed that it meant the Potters' son (a half-blood like himself) and resolved to personally kill the infant at any cost whatsoever. Dumbledore then hired Trelawney so that she would be safe from Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

Complicating Voldemort's plan, Snape secretly harboured a deep everlasting love for Lily Potter, since the two had been friends since childhood; so great enough that he covertly defected to the Order Of The Phoenix after he secretly told Dumbledore that Voldemort had marked her and her family for death, begging the legendary wizard to hide and protect the family from Voldemort at all cost.[14] Dumbledore agreed, and urgently bade the Potters to go into hiding under the protection of the Fidelius Charm. While James and Lily wanted Sirius Black to be their Secret-Keeper, because he was their closest and most trusted friend, and the fact the Sirius had been made Harry's godfather; it was for exactly those reasons that Black claimed that he was too obvious a choice and that Voldemort would suspect him. Instead, he suggested Peter Pettigrew, an ordinary wizard who no one would ever expect. Thus, the real traitor became the Potters' Secret-Keeper, though no one (not even Dumbledore or Lupin) knew of the switch, and within a week Pettigrew told his master Voldemort the Potters' location, officially breaking the Fidelius Charm and leaving the Potters completely vulnerable.[15] Meanwhile, Dumbledore discovered that James's invisibility cloak was in fact the Cloak of Invisibility, the third of the legendary Deathly Hallows.

On 31 October, 1981, Voldemort travelled to the Potters residence in Godric's Hollow. He then casually and secretly entered their house, and instantly and swiftly murdered James with the Killing Curse, who was unarmed, but he offered Lily a chance to save herself if she stepped away from the crib containing her infant son. Voldemort wished to honour Snape's request to spare Lily, but Lily refused and when Voldemort became agitated and angry, he gave her one last warning to move aside. Lily still refused, thus, Voldemort murdered her as well with the Killing Curse. He then turned his wand on Harry. However, Lily's loving sacrifice gave Harry an ancient and unbelievably powerful magical protection(an ancient counter-charm rooted in the power of love); and when Voldemort attempted to kill Harry with the Killing Curse, the curse rebounded and was deflected upon Voldemort himself. It was in that very moment, that Voldemort unknowingly made Harry himself his seventh and final Horcrux. However, it did not come without serious cost. The Killing Curse caused Voldemort's physical body to be destroyed and his power was completely broken and zapped from him. In addition, the curse left Harry with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead, and also secretly transferred an array of Voldemort's own power and magical skills to Harry: caused when the fragment of Voldemort's already mangled and shattered soul entered Harry and turned him into a Horcrux.

0,"I haven't seen anyone say this yet but for me, the marketing is the real crime of the movie. Although not all the marketing was bad and even though my memory is hazy of the real order of things, I can still remember the things that ruined it:

1. The title was revealed in a fancy gif showing us the main cast. I love this, a really great move on WB's part and it got the fans all hyped up and totally ready for the new movie.
2. They released action shots of our favourite characters. Again, a really great move as it gave nothing away to the plot or any massive spoilers and it served to keep the fans interested. 
3. The trailer came out. I initially really liked the trailer, it didn't give too much away and gave us some insight on the main plot. There was a shot of the Lestrange family tree so most theorists on youtube were able to work out that it was about Leta's family and something to do with Credence. Again, it didn't give too much away, just a sort of outline of the plot. 
4. Then they released posters of the main cast. This is where it starts getting bad. Everyone was pretty quick to see that all the good guys were facing one way and all the bad guys were facing the other, including Queenie. The fans put two and two together and combined with what we saw of Queenie from the trailer (crying in the rain) they concluded that Queenie was going to go to the dark side. This was also helped by another trailer (teaser? My memory is hazy) where Queenie and Grindelwald ARE IN THE SAME ROOM which just served to CONFIRM a whole secret plot point.
5. At one point they started releasing actual clips and scenes from the film and I don't know what this purpose was for? There is already a very loyal fan base and they don't need to keep giving us content to keep us interested. 
6. THE WORST was when they released the soundtrack list. This was... I don't even know... it was such a wtf moment for me and whoever's idea it was should have got fired. The names of tracks in a movie give away so much!!! And the tracks in this that gave away some key information was ""Leta's confession"" and ""The Blood pact"" LIKE WTF? WHY would you release this stuff? Relasing tracks like Salamander Eyes and Leta's theme and some other random ones is fine because they don't give away to anything in the plot but the Blood pact? Seriously? I just couldn't believe it. 
7. At this point I didn't think it could get much worse, but then the cast interviews started. Now, this is no hate or anything to the cast, it really wasn't their fault and I don't think they were given a proper briefing on what they could and couldn't say, but jesus the interviews gave away A LOT. And don't get me wrong I love them, but Katherine and Eddie were the worst. I know they probably had the most interviews next to Jude but just from these interviews circling round the entire plot to their relationship had been given away. I don't care if they only gave away ""exposition"", what might have been exposition to the producers was the entire subplot because, let's be real here, their relationship didn't go past the hour mark. Again, it's not really their fault, someone should have said ""hey in the interviews you can say X and Y, but for the love of god don't say A and B""
8. The Nagini reveal I wouldn't be so mad about if Nagini actually had a reason to be in the film. I mean props to Claudia, she said she was going to keep the secret until the premier but the interviewers (producers? marketing?) told her to say the name of her character. A really bad idea because the only thing that made her character interesting or kinda worth being in the movie was that she was Nagini (I'm sorry I said it) I know at the time the fans ate that shit up, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment that I will detail below:

Going into the theatre to watch this film I knew:

* Tina wasn't talking to Newt because she thought he was engaged to Leta and that she got a new boyfriend and Newt went to Paris to find her and tell her he was single but she doesn't want to listen
* Jacob and Queenie were going to show up at Newt's house and somehow Jacob and Newt end up going to Paris to find Tina
* The maledictus is Nagini, Voldemort's pet
* There was going to be a plot point about the Lestrange family
* Leta had a confession
* There was a blood pact, most likely between Dumbledore and Grindelwald
* Queenie was going to the dark side

It really sounds bad when I lay it all out like that. 

And the worst part is, when I watched the film it felt like I was watching all the trailers/clips/theories put together and I knew everything that was going to happen. The only twist was Leta and the thing with Credence at the very end. But that was sort of dampened by the fact that everything else was already spoilt for me. And I guess the worst thing was that the movie was not as great as the advertising and marketing made it out to be anyway, so I left the theatre feeling very empty and promptly went to join another fandom.

P.S it sounds like I went searching for this information, I didn't but I was knee deep in fandom at the time and anywhere I turned on the internet there was something circling round about the interviews, or a new theory, or a new clip or something. I tried to avoid all of these, but some of those tumblr posts just burn into your brain.

Someone please tell me whether they had the same experience or I'm just unlucky with the internet, because I haven't heard anyone say this.Unpopular opinion: bad marketing ruined FB3"

My theory is, that Dumbledore defeats Grindelwald not with his wand, but by combination of the envolvement of some magical beasts, convincing Credence to sacrifice himself to defeat Grindelwald (that is so Dumbledore) and some love protection that Leta's death gave to Newt (that's how Dumbledore learned about this love sacrifice spell)How Dumbledore will most probably defeat Grindelwald"

0,"Staying home too long made me fall back into the deep, dark, swirling tunnel of fantastic beast theorizing. It started out with me wondering if Corvus Lestrange could be alive (since his aunt could be a witch you just apparated from underwater), but then I looked up the actress...

Linda Santiago (Credence's aunt) is a Swedish actress, and it made me wonder why they chose to cast her rather than an extra or a UK actress, which means she'll probably have a larger role and her nationality plays an important part. And what schools happens to be in Sweden? Yup. Durmstrang! Aka Grindlewald's former school. 

So...what does the wiki say...  *""*[*Rita Skeeter*]( book* [*The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore*]( *explains that Grindelwald's* ***'twisted experiments'*** *had been the reason for his expulsion at 16 years old from Durmstrang before he could graduate. This was an ominous and troubling sign, as it meant that Grindelwald performed* ***experiments that were too disturbing*** *even for a school with a notably high tolerance of the* [*Dark Arts*]( But no, I don't believe Credence is the product of these experiments, but they were a precursor. And of course, if Credence is a baby in Leta's memory (1901), he would be too old. 

After he is expelled from Durmstrang, Grindelwald then goes to Godrick's Hollow and meets Dumbledore, yada, yada, yada...until 1900. After the three-way duel, he flees the country and starts his rise to power. 

Which *finally* leads me to my new theory...

What if after Grindelwald leaves Dumbledore, he returns to Sweden and continues with whatever experimentation got him expelled. What if (like how that Fan-Fic Harry Potter and the Cursed Child wanted so much), Grindelwald either had a child with a follower (I know he was believed to have a relationship with Dumbledore, but that doesnt mean he couldn't be bi or insincere), or was attempting to create a child.  However, I see the mother dying, which leads us to the boat. Credence's biological aunt, took him and attempted to escape Grindelwald and his fanatics by traveling to the United States. 

**TLDR... Grindelwald is Credence's biological father**

Swords;
Action, and therefore conflict of forces; the states and activities of the astral plane
New begining - mental level - plans of the future. Astral plan. Clearing of truth - no confusion - clear discision. Appears after time of confusion or worry. Speaking the truth to those who need to hear your point of view.
The symboles on the sword are the words of the Law. The sword is used in rites of creation. The handle is the energy of transformation, used to cut the unchosen and show the choices that will make change (for planned future). Set in motion of plans for future.

Cups;
Desires, hopes, wishes; emotional activities; the states and forces of the mental plane, the creative world
A card people want to see in regards to relationship matters as it is a card of balanced and even love. A relationship that can last that has both partners as equals supporting each other but standing on their own two feet too.
As we look at the image we see two fish entwined and feeding energy in the form of light into the lotus of spiritual love they are standing on – this shows them as separate yet also each has an equal footing in the relationship that is balanced. The fish symbolises love.
Being a ‘2’ card it is a card that has just differentiated from the unity of spirit into two things so the driving force is to return to that union, so in relationship we seek to unite with our lover and become one again
The background is yellow calm sea becoming green in the foreground indicating a sense of positive self regard and self esteem (the yellow) is the source of the love (green) and this relationship is founded in the self love that each person has of themselves – we can not fully love another until we love ourselves. In some cases it may well be that each person has indeed fallen in love with a reflection of themselves in the other person – something they may not yet have seen in themselves.

[The floating souls here mirror the creation of the blood pact. And loving a part of themselves in the other could be what Albus and Gellert's relationship was centered around.   Not being able to love until loving themselves could play in part on how to break the blood pact (i do believe it will be an internal growth on Dumbledore's part that will be required to destroy it).]

Death;
Hope destroyed - end - corruption/destruction.
Man - loss of a benefactor
Women - many contrarities
Maid - failure of mariage project
Mystical death - different than ordinary death (sometimes rebirth/renewal) - like sun setting and rising simultaneously. End and beggining, in different states.
Alchemy - putrefaction - series of chemical changes wich develops the final form of life - around the Orphic Egg (silver) witch hatched the golden winged premordial being.
Destruction preceding regeneration
Interpretations: destruction/creation - death - astral light balancing death and creation.

[I believe here the silver is Ariana and gold is Aurelius (from the latin origins) would mean Aurelius is born and intricately tied in with Ariana's death.]



Here are some of my predictions for the futre instalments as well.

1 Queenie is pregnant of Jacob in CoG, the child could be around 5 to 8 years old in the next one. Maybe we will see Grindelwald's indoctrination through his story (much like the youth who grew up under Hitler's riegn).

Queenie places her hand over her stomac, similar as to if she were pregnant.  Jacob asks her, in London, when she would let him be back 'after we've had five kids?'.  This could turn out to be foreshadowing if Queenie does end up to be pregnant.

2 very popular one, Ariana had an obscurus.

3 Jacob or Queenie will die (applies to the rest of the upcoming movies)

4 Aurelius is a new form of Ariana's obscurus.

5 Grindelwald will be using inferi in his armies, making useful the body of those who arent considered to be useful in his fight (as we saw him dispose of the muggle family in Paris and the aurors who did not join him).A couple notes on JK's tarrot card twitter header from a while back and what they could mean for the future of the series."

This is a guide to an ultime theory/explanation/prediction of the main plot of the Fantastic Beasts movie series.

Ariana Dumbledore gets attacked by three muggle boys because of her magic.

Percival Dumbledore in return attacks the boys to avenge his daughter for what they've done to her (rape?).

Percival gets a life sentence in Azkaban.

The Dumbledore family moves to Godric's Hollow to start a new life.

In the following years Ariana develops and Obscurus, because ever since the attack she would refuse to use her magic, and would try to hide it and suppress it.

Many consider Ariana to be mentally ill and demented after her attack. She talks alone in her bedroom with her imaginary friend (like many children who go through trauma), her only friend, this entity which comes to her in her solace, whom she has baptized, Aurelius.

Gellert Grindelwald is expelled from Durmstrang and goes to Godric's Hollow to live with his aunt, Bathilda Bagshot.

There he meets Albus Dumbledore and the two form a strong bond.

They shape each other's vision of how the world should be and start making plans of overtaking the International Statute of Secrecy.

Albus lets Gellert in on the darkest secrets of his family, and introduces him to Ariana, Aberforth and Kendra.

Gellert becomes a recurring presence in the Dumbledore Household. Even gets close to Ariana and plays with her. She's 14 but acts 9, and her constant talking to Aurelius is enough to send chills down anyone's spines.

Grindelwald has a vision, in which an Obscurial kills the greatest threat to his cause.

Albus and Gellert make the blood pact, promising to never fight each other.

In a fit of uncontrollable rage, triggered maybe by a fight in the Dumbledore Household concerning Albus and Gellert, Ariana's Obscurus gets unleashed and ends up killing Kendra (much like what happened to Mary-Lou Barebone).

Albus' plans of travelling the world with Elphias after graduation are hindered indefinitely.

Albus gets stuck with his hot-tempered younger brother, Aberforth, and his sick sister, Ariana.

Albus graduates Hogwarts.

Gellert tells Albus about his vision.

Gellert convinces Albus that they should take Ariana with them to protect her, and also because her powers would be useful against this unknown threat.

This causes the three-way duel between Albus, Gellert and Aberforth.

Ariana dies from a stray curse, and Grindelwald flees, knowing well that his relationship with Albus is forever ruined.

As Ariana's Obscurus screeches in agony and lashes out of its now dead host, Albus casts an enchanted vault around it to keep it safe, thinking that maybe Ariana can still be saved.

He takes it to the man with whom he already has a well-established friendship with, and is possibly the only wizard in the world with the knowledge he needs in this moment. Nicolas Flamel.

They both work together in an attempt to give Ariana's soul a new body to inhabit. A Homunculus, one of the greatest accomplishments of alchemy.

Ariana's Obscurus generates a body to itself through the Philosopher's Stone. But it's not Ariana, but her Dark Twin, her only friend, Aurelius Dumbledore.

Taken aback and completely distraught by the unsuccessful results, Albus decides to send the newborn to America with his maiden aunt Honoria, to be kept safe and hidden from Grindelwald, who would definitely desire the baby's inherited powers, as he already did with Ariana before.

Aurelius and Honoria and traveling with the Lestrange family, Leta and Corvus Lestrange, and the family servant, Irma. (According to the script, they clearly know each other, as most pure-blooded wizarding families do)

During the travel to America, Leta Lestrange swaps Aurelius with her half-brother, Corvus.

The ship wrecks in the middle of the Atlantic, and both Honoria and Corvus drown.

Irma, Leta and Aurelius survive the accident and make it to New York in safety.

Irma, who knew baby Corvus really well, (as his babysitter and servant of his family) realises that the baby she carries is not Corvus, but Aurelius, the baby Honoria Dumbledore was carrying in the bedroom next door.

Realising that both Honoria and Corvus are probably dead, Irma decides to continue Honoria's mission, since hers was cut short, and puts baby Aurelius up for adoption.

Irma and Leta go back to France, and both decide to keep this secret forever. Since revealing it would do no one no good.

News of the wreckage reach Albus. Both Honoria and Aurelius died in the sinking. A tragic, but definitive ""end"" to the terrible mistake he made.

Years pass. Grindelwald becomes a significant political idol and starts gathering followers around the world.

Hogwarts graduate Newt Scamander becomes a household name in Magizoology, and maintains correspondence with his old time professor, Albus Dumbledore.

Newt shares with Albus stories of his adventures. Including the one time Newt managed to capture an Obscurus and almost save the Obscurial.

Misterious and unexplained magical activity starts to happen in New York, and it threatens to expose the Wizarding community.

Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald realize that this activity is from a powerful Obscurus, since both have seen first-hand in the past how this activity looks like.

In 1926, Grindelwald has another vision. The obscurial is somehow related to the Second Salemers. At this point he already knows that the man from his first vision is Albus and not someone else.

Grindelwald infiltrates the MACUSA by impersonating Head of the Department of Aurors, Percival Graves, to search for the Obscurus under the radar and have valuable information from the American Wizarding government.

Dumbledore manipulates Newt into going to the United States, hoping he would save the Obscurial.

Credence turns out to be the Obscurial all along and is apparently killed by the MACUSA.

Grindelwald gets arrested.

Grindelwald escapes custody 6 months later.

In the following 3 months he gathers all existing information on Credence, including his adoption papers which states that he was given to adoption by a French woman named Irma Dugard.

This leads him to Paris, where he finds Irma, and uses legilimency (or torture) to extract all bits of information she has on Credence.

Grindelwald finds out that Credence was actually a Dumbledore child named Aurelius, who was sent to America by Albus accompanied by Honoria Dumbledore.

Grindelwald remembers Ariana's Obscurus was nicknamed Aurelius by her, and is struck with the realization that Credence is that entity itself, embodied.

Credence goes to Europe with Circus Arcanus, after learning his mother was French.

The Wizarding community worldwide starts to speculate who the Obscurial chil is. And most come to the conclusion he is the son of Corvus IV Lestrange returned from America, to help Grindelwald lead wizard-kind from the darkness.

Grindelwald sets into motion a plan to seduce Credence into his cause, using his desire to know his identity as bait.

Grindelwald sends his accolite leave a fake letter to Credence, claiming it was his mother, to lead him to Irma Dugard. Only to have her killed by Gunnar Grimmson right in front of him, stripping him of his hopes and making him even more vulnerable to his manipulation.

After that, Grindelwald orders Vinda Rosier and Abernathy to the French Ministry of Magic, to not only rule out the possibility of him being Corvus, but also to provide Credence evidence that the rumours regarding his identity are false. Again, smashing his hopes.

The rally happens at the Père-Lachaise and Credence and Queenie join Grindelwald's ranks.

At Nurmengard, Grindelwald gifts Credence with his wand and his rightful name, Aurelius Dumbledore.

They took a lot of time to develop Leta in COG and then just ended up killing her? Why  I  don't know she was probably the most interesting character so far apart from Dumbledore and Grindlewald. I don't think she placed any kind of love protection on Theseus and Newt because it feels sort of repetitive of Harry Potter (though it would be cool). And as much as I want her to be alive I feel like they wouldn't do a second fake-out death (like they did with Credence). But if the only reason for her death was to place a love protection on the brothers or make Newt choose a side why not just call her the girl Newt used to love and call it good? Why place so much of the movie on her character? I don't know it feels like such a massive waste of an opportunity. So what do you think will be her purpose in the next film?

Next is Theseus Scamander. He is a likable character (brave, caring, etc). But like why did they add him into the story in a story already so overfilled? Is it because they wanted to make Newt more relevant and his brother being the head of the Auror office does that? Is it so they can throw this Theseus-Newt-Leta love triangle? Is it so they can kill him later since they can't kill Newt, Tina, or Dumbledore? Also, Callum Turner is much younger than Eddie Redmayne so pretty soon he will start to look like the ""younger"" brother.

Newt Scamander, 120 years old, sits on a bench. His well-travelled suitcase, reupholstered, lies beside him. The red Hogwarts Express gleams and steams majestically. 


A young woman with extremely blonde hair approaches. In her sing-song voice, she says: “Sorry to leave you for a minute. I’m back for good.” It is Luna Lovegood. 


Newt’s smile lights up his face. He no longer looks quite so old. Luna gestures down the platform, “My friends.” 


Luna picks up the suitcase and sits down, placing the case between her feet. Clasped around her wrist like a bracelet, a bowtruckle lifts its head and gives a quick look around. 


Newt and Luna have real warmth for one another. She says, “Newt. Thank you for the case. It’s beautiful.” Newt’s eyes are full of emotion. “*Professor Lovegood*. Hogwarts doesn’t deserve you, but Care of Magical Creatures needs you. I’m very grateful Luna.”


A guard blows a whistle. Luna says, “Shall we?” Newt nods, “It will be good to see the old place again.” 


Luna stands and picks up the suitcase. She offers her free arm to the old man. Together they walk the few steps to the train. Luna pushes the case through the open door. Newt looks up the platform and sees —

0,‘Fantastic Beasts 3’ &amp; ‘King Richard’ Warner Bros. Productions Are Also On Hiatus: Coronavirus
0,"I have been giving this movie a lot of thought and there are three options explaining who Credence actually is:

1. He is a Dumbledore

I think it is safe to assume that Arianna Dumbledore (Albus and Aberforth’s little sister) was an Obscurial given the trauma she endured and what we know about her so far. So in theory it would make sense for Credence to be related to Arianna one way or another given they are both Obscurials. However, from the timeline (Arianna and Kendra both died in 1899, two years before Credence was born in 1901) it is clear that both Arianna Dumbledore and Kendra Dumbledore were dead by the time Credence was born. Percival as we know was a family man (protecting Arianna and going to Azkaban to save her going to St Mungo’s shows that) and he was at Azkaban, so it wouldn’t really make sense and it be difficult to explain a hidden child conceived while he was there. In addition, the traditional books are very clear that there are only three children in Dumbledore’s family and I think Rowling would have revealed this earlier or hinted at it. We also know that JKR loves symmetry and symbols, the numbers three and seven, etc. Three siblings definitely sounds more likely than four. In my view, it is therefore unlikely that he is in fact a Dumbledore like Grindelwald claims.

2. Grindelwald is lying and Credence is not a Dumbledore

Of course Grindelwald has an agenda and given the blood pact it would absolutely make sense for him to be lying to Credence to establish trust and then turn him against Albus. There are many ways he could have conjured a phoenix and it would absolutely make sense for him to do that as part of persuading Credence. We know phoenixes appear to Dumbledores in time of need and if Credence were to mention the phoenix in the future to Albus, it would be more likely for Albus to believe the story. There is also a hint in the first movie where Grindelwald uses the name ‘Percival’ in front of Credence - but again this could be a false trail.

3. Credence is a Gaunt

Some people have suggested that Credence could be related to Voldemort somehow given the timeline of events, e.g. that he could be Voldemort’s uncle if Marvolo had another child in addition to Merope we don’t know about. This would make some sense to explain Credence’s powerful magic and also provide another reason for Grindelwald to be drawn to him: the fact he was a descendant of Salazar Slytherin’s and therefore of the Peverell family. Remember - Dumbledore and Grindelwald were obsessed with the Hallows so it would explain their obvious interest in Credence.

However, they don’t even need to be as closely related as that. Here is my view. Credence could also be a more distant member of the Gaunt family, descended either of the branches in the UK or Ireland, or even in the U.S.

We do know that Ilvermorny School of Magic was founded by Isolt Gaunt (banished to the U.S. by her aunt). Before escaping, Isolt took a wand that belonged to her family, and which had previously belonged to Salazar Slytherin. (Source: JK Rowling: [ also interesting that it was JK herself who drafted this for Pottermore giving us this info)

Could the wand burried on the Ilvermorny grounds be the Elder Wand? After fighting her aunt, Isolt burried the wand on the school grounds, and a snakewood tree later grew there. It was William, a Pukwudgie, who actually killed the aunt, so the wand’s allegiance could actually be towards William. And we know William still lives in Ilvermorny, or at least one of his descendants.

So this would give Grindelwald additional motivation to get Credence on his side - namely to ‘fetch’ the Elder Wand for him. Perhaps in the coming movies we will come to see how Grindelwald first gained possession of the Elder Wand (and some nice shots of Ilvermorny!) before Albus Dumbledore won it in 1945. We don’t know much about Dumbledore’s wand prior to the Elder Wand, I wonder if part of the reason he won its allegiance is because his previous wand contained rowan? Rowling does say that ‘the owners of elder wands almost always feel a powerful affinity with those chosen by rowan.' [

The ‘fantastic beasts’ angle of course would also involve a Pukwudgie and I am sure lend itself to some awesome visuals in the movie, e.g. Newt trying to gain William the Pukwudgie’s trust, etc.

It will also be interesting to see the relationship between Nagini and Credence, i.e. could they be related somehow? Perhaps she is also a Gaunt which would explain the snake (the Maledictus charm is only passed from mother to daughter). Or alternatively they might not be related at all but still have a special sibling-like or other relationship given she transforms into a snake and Credence is a descendant of Slytherin's? This could later explain Nagini’s allegiance to Voldemort in the subsequent books (and why she is against Grindelwald now), why she went to visit Voldy in the orphanage (perhaps that’s what Voldemort showed those kids in the cave?), why she let Voldemort possess her snake body (eg when attacking Arthur Weasley, JK has said this was unusual and shows a special bond).

It would also reinforce Dumbledore’s  interest in the Gaunt family - it is unusual for a headmaster to hand deliver a letter to Hogwarts to an orphanage, isn’t it? The visit must have happened in 1938, perhaps as part of Dumbledore’s own search for the Hallows during this time. Hopefully something we will see throughout the series.

**Summary:** Grindelwald lied, Credence is not a Dumbledore. Credence is a descendant of the Gaunt family (who founded Ilvermorny) and distantly related to Voldemort. Grindelwald needs Credence to: a) fight Dumbledore given the blood pact and b) fetch the Elder Wand (Salazar Slytherin’s old wand) from Ilvermorny for him. Credence and Nagini have a special bond which will explain Nagini's allegiance to Voldemort later on.Credence's real identity"

0,"So COG was not well received.... and Rowling is replaced as screenwriter. I read both of the screenplays alone, and I thought they read rather well, as a former acting student having read many scripts and screenplays. 

The studio sees her as the new ingredient to the production, and therefore what isn’t working. But Rowling has no published source material for this, so will Steve kloves only give us something further from the truth, or will he protect Rowling’s work as I believe he has done in the past?

Kloves is a talented writer and has respect for Rowling’s vision and I admire that, but there were things particularly in the past few movies that were left out of the story that made the story make far less sense. I really hope the series doesn’t suffer from over -simplification. FB’s strength in my eyes lies in its complex convoluted and detailed  story telling. 

I’ve grown VERY tired of David Yates vision especially since fantastic beasts started. Crimes of grindelwald had some truly appalling shots, overly perfected and too many wide angle lens shots and close up shots. I think he’s not the best at playing into the depths while he gets the fun details and brings that to life, the underlying themes he really struggled with in COG that were abundantly clear when reading the screenplay, and not so clear while watching.

I think Rowling’s work is due for a new vision entirely and frankly I’ve been waiting for Guillermo del toro to hop on board, since he was asked for POA. Fantastic beasts is a better project for him anyways. Newt and Tina would be wonderful through his eyes, as well as the artistic direction and the beasts, since he has this obsession with monsters. He’s brilliant at playing into the themes that he wants to convey, and a beautiful storyteller, and has expressed interest.

I’m curious about what other Potter heads think of this recent development, if they agree with the decision, disagree, or they have any other ideas they’d like to see :)Looks like Rowling is replaced as screenwriter, but should it be Yates being replaced?"

So mcgonagall in fantastic beasts... everyone’s like how was she there in 1910, and 1927... when the books say she was born 1935....

Yessss it is POSSIBLE that it’s just retconning BUTTT

Who gave hermione the time turner?
What did mcgonagall do for just two years after graduating hogwarts? 
Why is she an animagus?...

All of these questions have answers that point to mcgonagall being a sneaky little time traveler, perhaps under dumbledores orders.

After mcgonagall graduated hogwarts in the 50s she had a stint at the ministry according to the Potter more story (which refuses to acknowledge the year that she was born). 

In order of the Phoenix she also mentions that aurors sometimes are required to become animagi to Harry when he’s looking into becoming an auror.

The ministry was where time turners were hidden and destroyed. I forget what year they were outlawed, maybe somebody can remind me...

But she was there in 1910 legit chasing down leta lestrange. Dumbledore undoubtedly was aware that she was there, they were colleagues, and I believe she plays an important role in the conflict with grindelwald, and all that history explains their closeness and her willingness to advise and work with dumbledore in the personal way that she does. 

My guess. Dumbledore told her at graduation to get a job at the ministry, become an animagus, use a time turner as an auror to come back and work as a hogwarts professor, and that it was imperative that she did, just as he advised Harry and hermione to use the time turner in prisoner. He knew that they had gone back in time and in the laws of Harry Potter you go back to make sure what has been done, is actually done (aside from cursed child which I think we should all disregard.) 

So why become an animagus? To be a spy? Just as she was on the Dursley’s? My personal opinion is to hide from her childhood self while she is at school in the 40s and 50s. 

I mean it kind of explains all of the gaps in mcgonagalls character. Why was she so eager to give hermione a time turner? Why did she only spend two years at the ministry? Why is she a registered animagus? Why is she dumbledores sidekick? 

I’m just sayin... lemme know what you think.Fantastic beasts Mcgonagall loves her time turners I swear (Posting again)"

The fantastic beasts franchise needs to give up their award season opening tradition and go for a summer 2021 release. The Wizarding world is such a summer thing too. Most of the books came out in the summer. 

Would anybody be down to start a petition to get it released a little earlier, maybe a late June or July  2021 release? I think it’s honestly the smartest move for WB. The Wizarding world never got the Oscar recognition it really deserved anyways, especially when it came to the actors like Alan rickman and Maggie smith. 

I don’t think the academy has any chance of taking FB too seriously at the moment, and if they do, it really won’t matter when they release the movie tbh. If they up the visual effects, and come in stronger, it would be a better summer blockbuster.

0,"On this page ( [

i found some very intruging clues on the origin of the Obscurus. I think this is really close to the thruth. I know JK Rowling already had written the basic plot of the whole series before FB started filming. And ofcource that includes the Obscurial plot. With that in mind:

So found this rather 'odd' concept art. A naked human in a box? With veins like it's growing in there or something...(Like the veins you see in a developing chicken in the egg. Or human in the womb) I had to zoom in to see if there even was a head. I found the way it clutches itself rather haunting. Especially the way his right hand holds his ankle. I thought it was just to express extreme discomfort and pain.

&amp;#x200B;



Then i noticed that the piece of Voldemorts 'soul' clutches itself in the exact same way. Except Voldemort arms go OVER the arm/leg and the human in the box UNDER the arm/leg. It is so specific i don't think it's accidental.... Not that this thing is Voldemort but perhaps like a 'part of a tortured soul' thingy. Far fetched? I have more that supports this theory!

&amp;#x200B;



Second in here i definately see the Obscurus and something human, or something that has the form of a human, trying to break free. Also this image had a background. It seems its standing on a very old wooden table. Or wooden floor. It's hard to get a feeling of the size of this thing.

Also a dark, dusty, dirty room with the lightfall coming in... Hogwarts? Nicolas Flames house?



&amp;#x200B;



Ok now comes something i consider a spoiler and not a theory! the NAME of the files are:  **Boswell\_obscurus\_girl !!!**

That's right check the filenames yourselves. The ones with the humanoid in the box are all named Obscurus GIRL. All the other ones are named Obsurus. (Without the girl)

In the first pic you don't see the face. In the second if i look at the lips it could be female. The nose and lips are the same in both pics. The shape of the nose looks a bit african american though.... And it's definately NOT Ezra Miller's nose. Though Ezra Miller IS featured in other concept art on the same page. It also doesn't seem to picture Arianna to me. Purely by the shape of the nose and lips. It seems to be an adult face by the shape of the head and the teeth as well. The only woman of color in FB where Picery and Leta. Both make no sense is this context.... So i would say the face is based not on a character we have seen on screen so far.

But hey, filenames dont lie! Arianna obscurus confirmed in my book! Though you may say there is a tiny change Credence was a girl rather then a boy in the early design fase, there is a lof of Ezra miller as Credence art.

From what i gather is that it IS INDEED Arianna's obscurus in here. It also seems by the veins that something 'humanoid' is beeing incubated and trying to escape with the file name labeled not simply 'Obscurus' but specifically 'Obsurus girl'. Like Ariana's obscurus to differiate from Crecence obscurus.

So maybe this explains WHY there is no much time difference between Ariana's 'death' and Crecence's. They where messing about with the Obscurial. Again the body and face seem to be of an adult female not with Arianna's features. It seems to then escape after 'incubating'. Perhaps briding the timegap of Arianna's death and give Crecence a few years to grow up from a baby to get to a child repressed long enough to become a 'viable' host.

I mean they do not make concept art completely random. JK rowling planned the whole series in advange. You see early concepts for the Erumpent, Niffler and Occamy. And they ended up in the movie just looked different. You also see a lot of early concept art for the Obscurial and Credence. I see reason to suspect that in some way this early concept art will actually come to play out later.

Which sights will we see in the third film and where could the Brazilian Ministry of Magic be? I searched in the Internet and found out that the statue of ""Christ the Redeemer"" was built in 1931. I think they will use this statue in promotion material (like the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower in the first two films) so we can expect a time jump of at least 4 years.

I would place the concept art of around FB1. And very early in the development stage at that.

I've never seen the obscurius portraid like this. Rather then 'Angry smoke' it seems like a giant scorpion with a millipede body and if you look a bit closet it's actually make up from digusting looking insects. 

Now in FB2 we learned in the deleted rooftop scene with Nagini the Obscurus isn't all that bad. It just seemed to float around a bit, didn't harm Nagini at all and seemed fine obeing Credence.

Now if the Obscurus looked like this in FB1 it would be obvious the Obscurus is 'Evil to the core'. But it seems they purposely didn't take that round.

Also i think it's from FB1 because Dumbeldore looks nothing like Jude Law but rather then how JK Rowling described him in the books. With his red hair. 

It seems to me this would have been the scene where we see Grindelwalds vision. Perhaps cut because they didn't cast Dumbeldore yet. Or they could have just 'Filmed him from the back'. (Much like Grindelwalds first scene. Check it, that ain't Jonny Depps neck we're seeing!)

0,"Hi! i recently looked back at the ilvermorny song, and feel like i’ve figured some interesting stuff out with what i’ve been confused by. Though i believe yates said it didn’t fit the mood, i feel like there was another big reason the song didn’t make FBAWTFT ultimately, which is because the canon from that song is different from the final draft lore we have.

The first big portion of this confusion is the opening noises. We hear queenie “cucaw” and tina “purr”. This always confused me, as you’d think the noises made before the song would be indicative of the noise-maker’s house. the cucaw is easy to link to the thunderbird, and the purr to the wampus, so i believe in earlier drafts of FB1, Queenie was a thunderbird and tina a wampus (though queenie, as we know, was in the final draft a pukwudgie and tina a thunderbird)

The other aspect that confused me was the song’s story. it makes no mention of Isolt, i initially though, but knew her father sometimes called her morrigan after her famous witch ancestor, so i let it slide. This was until i realized that the song indicates the witch that fled ireland and founded ilvermorny did so due to muggle persecutors, not an evil aunt, something isolt did not flee for. I believe initially jk planned for Morrigan to be the founder of Ilvermorny, and the song shows us her initial ilvermorny founding story.

0,"I've seen many great theories in this sub lately. This is my contribution to the discussion. It started out as a comment on one of the posts, but has gotten rather long, so I decided to post it separately, as a 2 part essay.

These are some of the questions I will try to answer:

1. How does Grindelwald know about Aurelius? (part 2)
2. What were his plans in CoG?
3. How much did Irma know about Credence's true identity?
4. How did Grimmson's role change from first draft to final cut and what does that mean?

But first some thoughts on FB canon and how to make sense of it.

# On methodology or how to deal with changing canon

First, we need to remember that the screenplay is not written solely by Rowling. She may have the final say on it, but Yates and the cast do influence the story in a really major way. Rowling has given them almost unprecedented levels of creative freedom. Which is great, if:

* the script is mediocre
* the script is well known (think Shakespeare)
* it's a standalone story

But Rowling is a great storyteller, and while we enjoy artistic interpretations (fan fiction) precisely because we see where and why they divert from the original (like adaptations of Shakespeare) we want to know ***her*** story. And this is the biggest problem with FB2, IMO. The **script was heavily edited** during production. What we see is not the original, not even the shooting script. We can only guess at what her story was. All changes to the script have to be agreed with her, but she’s happy to do give that permission. **She seems to enjoy the collaborative process**:

&gt;The process will work as follows: she’ll produce a draft of the script, and she’ll send it to \[Yates\] and to our producers, and we’ll all sit down and we’ll deconstruct what’s there, and there’s always this extraordinary range of ideas beating away in there… - Yates.  
&gt;  
&gt;They’ve said, “How about this?” and I thought, “No, that’s not gonna work.” Then you go and think, “Yeah, actually, that does work brilliantly. Why didn’t I think about that in the first place?”  - Rowling. ^(Rowling. A World Revealed. COG bonus material.)

What further complicates the matter is that there isn’t even one definite “Rowling” version, as **she keeps changing her own story**. That's just how she writes; what got into print is the ***official canon***, but in her head there are many “ghost plots” and “alternative universes”, that’s why she sometimes forgets potter canon.

Hence inconsistencies. She makes changes to the script to incorporate new ideas, but forgets some of the smaller details that now don’t make sense. Many subtle connections between story parts are lost  and it **no longer flows organically**. She may fix the major inconsistencies, but the progression of the story still doesn’t seem realistic.

This, I believe, is what happened to **Irma's storyline** (and who knows how many others).

Someone probably pointed to her that in her script a lot happens by coincidence: *Hey, Jo, the fact that Grimmson missed Credence and killed Irma* ***really*** *works in Grindelwald’s favor, doesn't it? Wait, but isn’t he a master manipulator? What if he set the whole thing up? Wouldn’t that fit his character and the main theme of the film (crimes) perfectly?* Indeed, it would. But when analyzing the **far-reaching** implications of that part of the story we have to **take into account her original plan**, because it probably connects with the main plot better.

# Grindelwald killed Grimmson in the shooting script

We know that in the shooting script he **did not recruit Grimmson** to his cause and did not ask him to kill Irma. There's a line in ""Crimes of Grindelwald - The Archive of Magic"" book that says:

&gt;When Grimmson gets too close to Credence, it’s the beast hunter who’s murdered in his own tracks. ^(p.121, an article on Grindelwald's crimes)

It seems that Grimmson tried to kill Credence (and, I assume, really hit Irma by accident) but was killed by Grindelwald, who was protecting Credence, supposedly in the same scene (Irma’s house). If Credence saw this, it would explain his final decision to go with Grindelwald. In the early version of the film it was made more clear that aurors actively tried to find Credence. I wonder if they kept those scenes, wouldn’t that be a better way to bring everyone to the cemetery? The way it’s now does seem a bit contrived. Especially Jacob – do crystal balls really work like that?

# As to Grindelwald's plan, I think he wanted:

1. Credence to find the Lestrange family tree and learn that he is not a Lestrange somehow.
2. Aurors to kill one of his followers in front of the audience.
3. Queenie to come to the rally and join his ranks because of her talents.

That’s it. I don’t think he wanted Newt and Tina. I’m not sure about Leta. I don’t think he intended to recruit her or anything, but he may have lured her to the cemetery to tell the story only she knows.

# Irma probably knew that Credence wasn't Corvus, but did she know who he really was?

There's some conflicting evidence.

If Grindelwald **didn’t plan her murder**, then he was sure that

1. she doesn’t know Credence’s true identity
2. she knows he is not Corvus (so he keeps searching)

***But*** in the script it is clear that Irma knew Credence’s aunt:

&gt;*The ship lurches again. IRMA snatches BABY CREDENCE, not noticing the switch amid confusion. The cabin door bangs open to reveal a dark-haired young woman wearing a nightdress and life jacket.*  
&gt;  
&gt;CREDENCE'S AUNT  
&gt;  
&gt;Irma? They want us to put on life jackets!

I doubt it’s a mere coincidence that the script has them interact. But there’s a possibility that they met on the ship and/or Irma didn’t recognize the baby.

[Part 2: Irma, Abernathy and How Grindelwald learned about Aurelius]( Canon or Did Grindelwald plan to kill Irma? - part 1/2 of of Irma, Grimmson, Grindelwald's schemes and how he found out about Aurelius/Credence's identity - THEORY discussion"
0,"In my opinion, Credence is a Dumbledore. Or, at least, there is/was a Dumbledore named Aurelius. I don’t think Grindelwald made up a whole new person. I won’t try to guess how he came to be or how exactly he is related to Albus Dumbledore: I think there are some facts we don’t know yet, we should wait and see what Rowling will reveal about this family in FB3.

I assume Grindelwald truly believes Credence to be Aurelius. Here I will look at how he (and only he) could’ve discovered this.

# How did Grindelwald find out about Aurelius Dumbledore?

&amp;#x200B;

* Grindelwald discovered Credence's true identity through his **visions** and **3 months of research**.
* He could’ve been researching old **archive records** on Mary Lou, and found out about Irma and that she was on the same ship with two Dumbledores (aunt and a baby). He probably did his research on Dumbledores years ago, but thought that those two died when the ship sank.
* Some other wizards reached the same conclusion: that Credence was Corvus. That means there really were some records that connected Barebones to the Lestranges (like names of the passengers on the ship, adoption papers).
* But only **Grindelwald somehow realized that the babies had been switched**. There are several possibilities:

1. he saw it in a vision
2. he found someone who knew it. **Irma** seems the best (and only) candidate. Maybe she only knew he wasn't Corvus. Or she knew the whole truth. But why didn't she tell Credence then? Why Grindelwald was willing to risk her telling him, if, as it seems the case in the first draft, he didn't order Grimmson to kill her?
3. he met the real Corvus, who is **Abernathy**. Really, Corvus must be alive because Bellatrix married a Lestrange. Grindelwald could’ve received a proof he is one (Abernathy being able to access their vault).

Either way, what matters is that there were many possibilities for Grindelwald (and anyone with access to (more or less) public records) to discover that it was Irma who gave Credence Barebone for adoption, that she was on that ship, and find the names of all the other passengers. Maybe there were just 2 babies on the ship.

Anyone could've found that out.

But **only Grindelwald knew that Credence isn't Corvus**. That leaves Credence as possibly a Dumbledore. He deduced that Credence is Aurelius Dumbledore, a boy that was also on that ship but is now believed to be dead. Of course, he'd still need proof. And he had it.

1. Grindelwald had visions about him (so Credence has to be someone important, one way or another)
2. saw his immense power in New York
3. and as the final proof – a phoenix has come to Credence.

So that’s what convinced him that Credence is a Dumbledore everyone (if they knew of him at all)  thought dead.

I believe that proves why Grindelwald and no one else was able to discover the truth. He had all the necessary pieces of a puzzle. **He researched Dumbledores** ***and*** **Lestranges.** He was one step ahead of the purebloods who researched Lestranges but didn't realize that Credence wasn't one. He was one step ahead of Dumbledore, who knew both families (I believe he started to research the Lestranges very recently, around the time the rumors about Credence's lineage started)  but didn't know Abernathy or had any other reason to think that the babies were switched and Credence wasn't a Lestrange. Maybe he will learn that it was the same ship his aunt was on in the next movie, and start to have his suspicions.

Of course, the bigger mystery is how Aurelius/Credence was born. But I believe Rowling will find a way to explain this. Even if she has to tweak some canon timelines. She's known to do that. My personal favorite theory is that he is a Homunculus (theory of S.Sipal on youtube) But I believe Rowling will go for the simplest and most natural explanation.

Frankly i think FB simply is no longer a priority for WB. Sure it'll be released in 2 years. But it seems to be a 'B' listing now. I think they try to 'market' the delay as 'we need 3 years cuz it's gonna be so good we absolutely need it'!

But it doesn't feel like it anymore. Like they let a lot of people go and give their other 'top men' time to get to work on other 'A' projects instead.

Ofcource you can't say that out loud! Just like the actors say they script of FB3 is amazing. It's marketing. Noone will see the movie if the actor is honest and says 'It's kinnda meh...'.

I mean HP movies don't take 3 years.... They never did before. They really need 3 TIMES as much time as Avengers Endgame? A movie with the plot lines, number of actors and sheer amount of special effects.

Really?

No not really.

Frankly i think it's just marketing. Other then maybe JK Rowling sat in her house 'tweaking the scipt' (So Newt enters scenario A. He sees B. B talks to Newt. Both characters leave scenario'. Yeah not even writing from scratch takes more then a couple of weeks)  for a bit pretty much FB has been halted for a year.

That is why there is 0 news. 0 work is really done. We will get FB3 but it will be like FB2. Not bigger or better. I am sure the only 'script rewrites' that ARE done is to drop Credence and Newts character development in more in favor of unnessasary Harry Potter references. I mean why develop a character and make sure we start to care for a character when you can show Newt ride a Kelpie? Or make a complicated movie and overstuff it with a character that you may or may not use in a film YEARS FROM NOW!

0,"*WORTH READING IN ITS ENTIRETY*

After my previous post I made yesterday I couldn't stop thinking about the Irma situation. What did she know and what she didn't.
We are not told in any way by the scenes we've got from her that she still thinks Credence is Corvus Lestrange, it's a assumption made by fans but one that I find really unlikely. It would be pretty stupid for her to not realize that the baby she was carrying was not Corvus, I mean, babies look similar, but not identical, and for someone who knew Corvus very well, probably was involved in his birth and took care of him she would definitely know his body and features very well. Of course in the chaos of the wreckage she did not realize it, it was dark everyone was desperate and running around. I believe that she may have only noticed something was off when they made it to the rescue boat, or even to America.
Then I think she must have asked Leta what had happened, if she knew how the babies got swapped, and Leta, like any other easily impressionable child, and after a little bit of pressure, would reveal her ""mistake"" and Irma would be really angry, but at the same time, comprehend that Leta was just a foolish child. Why Irma didn't tell anyone? Well, there are several reasons for that.
First and foremost, Leta's safety. Irma wouldn't want Leta to face the wrath of Corvus Senior. He already had little affection for her, and if he found out his daughter had killed his favorite child, God knows what could've happened.
Second. It really didn't matter anymore. Baby Corvus was sent to America to never return, to live a new life, hidden, unaware of his past and protected from the Kama Family. Being dead or not, Corvus Senior would never see him again, or reach out to him, risking exposing his whereabouts and identity. In a way, death was the safest thing for him. A son cruelly banished.
In the script it's clear that Irma and Honoria knew each other, and in the movie we see they were next door to each other, so I think it's safe to assume that they were traveling together, for similar reasons. Hear me out: If the theory about Aurelius being a ""dark twin"" of Ariana, created by means of alchemy, or any other means you see fit, is true, then Dumbledore would have realized he made a terrible mistake, not only mingling with very dark and unknown magic but also making that child a Target to Grindelwald, who obviously wanted to harness that power in Ariana. So I think that maybe these two, very powerful Wizarding families, Lestranges and Dumbledores, had a close relationship, like most famous Wizarding families, and reached out for each other for help, realising both had similar problems they decided to act together to protect their 2 newborn especial boys. Maybe even in Ariana's funeral, Corvus may have attended with his family and revealed to young Albus about his tricky situation with his son, telling him he is going to send him to America for protection, and that may have sparked this idea on Albus' head. Or vice versa, maybe Dumbledore revealed his secret to Corvus and he hoped in the plan.
Going back to Irma and Honoria, they probably knew of each other's situation, maybe not in the most gruesome details, but at least who the other baby were. When Irma realised she had saved baby Aurelius and not Corvus, she decided to at least help that child, since she couldn't help Corvus. She continued Honoria's mission and sent Aurelius to the orphanage, where he would eventually be adopted by Mary-Lou Barebone. After returning to France with Leta, they kept this secret for ever, since it would cause more drama and trauma than it already had.  Leta as a child, probably didn't know who the other baby was, because probably they decided to keep all that tragic story from her, she was too young and didn't need to be told the dark secrets of the Dumbledores, that's why she couldn't tell Credence who he was.
And this brings us finally to the title of this post. How did Grindelwald found out about all this? Well, we know that in the first movie he didn't know who Credence was, and dismissed him as a squib. I believe it's pretty safe to assume that after seeing Credence's face in his vision he asked him to see his adoption papers to learn who he was. Realising that not only his age was way off the normal age of an obscurial, and that his ""mother"" Irma was no one of relevance he started using him as an inside man in the Second Salemers, to identify the Obscurial and bring them to him. When the big reveal happens in the end of FB1 (Credence revealing he is the Obscurial), Grindelwald is really surprised, and between that moment and his escape 6 months later, he had no time to investigate Credence's life.
Then after his escape, we are told that three more months have passed, and many fans wondered why that extra time skip was added to the film. Simple. In those three months, Grindelwald collected all possible information about Credence, which lead him to the person who was responsible for him as a baby, Irma. Grindelwald being an extremely powerful and talented wizard must have used legilimency, torture or any means at his disposal to extract every ounce of information that Irma had in her (Not unlike what Voldemort did to Bertha Jorkins in GoF to extract everything she knew about the Crouch Family). And I think we fans were very blind to all this, because we know that Grindelwald knows who Irma is and where she lived, because he sends Credence that fake letter. So it's crazy to think that he wouldn't have gone there himself first, get all the information he needed, and then obliviated her so she wouldn't remember him ever being there. 
So that explains a lot of the questions in my previous post here. I believe that by that scene we see Grindelwald establishing his headquarters in Paris, he was already in on all the history of the Dumbledores and the Lestranges, he knows who Credence is and he lays down a plan to destroy all his hopes of getting this information, killing Irma right before she tells him, bringing the family tree into the mausoleum to show him that the recent rumours are fake, and making sure Leta was there to testify her story and put a definitive end to those rumours. If this is the case, then all that talk about Grindelwald being a master manipulator makes sense, and the plot of the second movie doesn't feel as contrived as it once did.How does Grindelwald know about Aurelius? - THEORY"

0,"There's one thing that really drive me nuts whenever I'm watching Crimes of Grindelwald. Which is, what exactly was Grindelwald's plan and which clues and bread crumbs he left to whom? Hear me out. We believe that by the beginning of the movie, in the 3 months after his escape, he already knows about Credence's true identity. And despite knowing where Credence is, he does not go there and take him, because of course, he wants him to trust him and come to him freely. There's this rumour in the Wizarding World, and especially amongst Wizarding aristocracy, that Credence will be the one to lead them from the shadows, that he will fight alongside The Liberator Grindelwald and that both will knock down the Statute of Secrecy. They believe Credence to be lost son of Corvus Lestrange Senior. Grindelwald knows Credence is not Corvus, and this is where things get confusing: 

1. The Letter. He sends Credence a fake letter from Irma Dugard, telling him to go visit her. Grindelwald sets it up with Grimmson so that Credence can get there just in time to meet her, but not enough so that she would tell him about who he is. And this raises questions. What would Irma tell Credence? Does she knows that the babies were swapped? If so, does she knows that he was Aurelius and would have told him there and then, and if that's the case was Grindelwald afraid that she would ""steal"" from him his ""secret weapon"" to ""seduce"" Credence into his arms? Why then not kill her before? Did Irma still thinks that Credence is Corvus and would have told him that, and what Grindelwald was trying to avoid was Credence getting an answer (regardless of it being fake, there was no way Credence would have known) that could have stopped him from going to rally at the Pére-Lachaise to find out his identity.
What was the point of sending him there?! Was it to bash all his hopes and make him more susceptible to Grindelwald's influence? The thousands of interpretations of this scene drive me nuts! Because clearly Grindelwald set this meeting up meaning for Credence and Irma to interact moments before her death, moments before she tells him what he wants to hear, what Grindelwald wants to be the one to reveal.

2. The Lestrange Family Records. We first see Vinda and Abernathy stealing the records, probably to get undeniable proof to Grindelwald that Corvus was indeed dead and could not be Credence. Ok. Later we see Abernathy planting it on the Lestrange Maosoleum for.... For whom? They left a message in the records room saying the records had been moved.... A massage to whom? Who they wanted to lure to the cemetery using that message? Certainly not Credence, since Grindy invites him personally on the rooftop scene. Maybe Leta? What Grindy wanted with her? Newt? Tina? Did he wanted to kill them in revenge after the events in New York? Did Grindelwald know about what Leta had done to Corvus and wanted her to be there with the family tree as evidence to share her story and once again, bash Credence's hopes, leaving him more desperate and hopeless? This is what makes the most sense to me, but still I would like to know if you guys have any other less contrives explanation.

3. Queenie. When Tina enters the Auditorium at the Cemetery she tells Newt that it is a trap, to which Newt replies: ""Yes. Queenie, the Family Tree, it's all been bait"". Queenie was bait to whom? Jacob? What on Earth would Grindelwald want with Jacob? Tina and Newt? Again, for the same reasons I've mentioned above? 
I understand him wanting Queenie on his side, she is an extremely talented legilimens and will definitely make Grindelwald's mission easier, but she was not a bait in that moment. Also, how did Grindelwald even knew Queenie was in Paris? Uuurrgh! So many questions!

In the end I think all those questions come down to this: What the hell was Grindelwald's plan concerning Credence? Who he wanted to attend the rally? Who he wanted to join him? Who he wanted to kill?Grindelwald's Trap in CoG????"

In FB1 he's very upset Credences dies. Or well, at least he tries to save him right? In FB2 he's like 'You talk about Credence as if he were still alive'. And when he hears he's alive he doesn't seem to give a shit other then minimal suprise. When he learn they ask him to kill him (Seriously, they expected him to say yes?) and the hire another one to do it instead he doesn't give a shit. He doesn't like the hitman for personal reasons (beasthunter) but not that he's to kill a child. He doesn't even try to talk the ministry or his brother out of it.  He just storms off.

Worse when he learns Tina is in Paris he just follow his dick around to find her. He doesn't go to Paris to help Credence but he DOES go when he may get some Tina pussy.... When he find her he doesn't even tell her 'Hey, maybe some usefull knowledge. There is a hitman here in Paris to assasinate Credence'. Nope he's just pissed she is dating someone else. And when he meets Credence he doesn't seem to care for him one bit but yet again is following his dick now pointing to Leta.

He's so uncaring he just let's Credence walk away. Same with Kowalski. He did a tearfull farewell in FB1 and now he's suprised to see him but i dunno. It's more like 'Dude how you here?' rather then ""OMG, MY friend! I thought i never see you again!"" Or in the 'Do you suffer from motion sickness' then not caring for the awnser. He was just generally short with Kowalski in Paris. Maybe it was ment humorous but he seemed less of a pal and more someone he dragged along.

Same with the Niffler. He just rudely orders him around like a dog. Well, he was kinnda mean to him in FB1 but Picket i dunno. When Picket hangs on a treat he just looks amused when he falls from quite a hight not helping as he litterly hangs on a tread. Then i'm not even sure what happens he jumps the little guy so it can't catch the button he's after. The whole scene just look odd. Like he's bullying him.... I'm in sure (In the deleted scene) he hurt the tiny niffler baby when he unceremonously thows him in the suitcase. And we can see the top of a tree or large bush so it was a fall either way for a tiny baby. Why where they in a tiny cage anyway? No wonder they broke out

0,"I have enjoyed the fantastic Beast films - I don’t think there is much that can keep me from loving being in the world of Harry Potter, but there is *one thing* in particular that I think would help the fantastic beast films. 

When “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” came out I was ecstatic! I really enjoyed the newly introduced characters (Jacob Kowalski in particular) and was intrigued as to where the series would go from there. The film had a lighter tone in contrast with the last 3 or 4 Harry Potter flicks, and seemed to be tickling the whimsy inside of me. However, one thing I believe threw me off was the pacing.  

I mean pacing in two different senses: The first in the traditional sense, in that the film hops from plot point to plot point too quickly for my liking. The second sense is the one I’ve not seen to many people talking about, and that is pacing the sense of time. One of the most distinguishing factors of the Potter films in contrast to the Fantastic Beasts films is how time passes within the narrative. 

In the Potter films/books, the narrative takes place over the course of a year, and this leaves room for a variety of different scenes. Scenes that include downtime of the Characters just talking to each other; the time that lets you get to know these characters better before we throw them into action and continue with exposition. “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” takes place over the course of 2-3 days. Obviously it’s not a sin in movies for narratives to take place over a few days, but in a film like this, I believe it would help. It becomes jarring when two romantic relationships (New/Tina &amp;amp; Jacob/Queenie) develop in such a short span of time - normally relationships don’t organically develop like that. In the Potter films relationships have ample time to grow believably. 

Now “Fantastic Beasts the Crimes of Grindelwald” comes out and let me preface: I came out of the theater thrilled because I loved the tone of the film and enjoyed following the characters (Mainly the ones introduced in the first film),  but this movie really suffered from the 2-3 day narrative. J.K Rowling loves storytelling that involves throwing many bits of information at you; she basically writes mystery novels set within a modern fantasy setting. The Potter films/books follow 3 kids unraveling mysteries within a 10 months span of time, and it seems realistic to slowly introduce new characters within the course of a year; where “Fantastic Beasts The Crimes of Grindelwald” introduces characters rapidly and gives no time to develop them, because the story has to continue at a rapid pace. 

It FEELS like Harry has developed a massively important relationship with Ron during his first 10-month adventure at Hogwarts because of the pacing. To me it’s simple: It will not jive right with some people when a story does not fit within the space of a few days. J.K Rowling just doesn’t write scripts that are best suited for such short periods of time. 

Please let me know what you think about this. I do love this franchise and don’t want people to think I’m jumping on the hate train or something akin. I just think the conversation about its future is valuable to its fans and creators.The Fantastic Beast Films and Time Within a Narrative."

0,"The more I think about these movies thus far, the less I'm sure they're as character driven as I think they should be. The characters in the first movie felt more likable than in the 2nd one. I like Newt, but I feel like he hasn't grown or been challenged much at all in these stories, especially during the last movie, just felt like he was going through the motions instead of going though character development.

Even though not everybody liked the turn, at least Queenie kinda had something of an arc in TCOG. Poor Tina has been given little substance thus far. Jacob has been fine. Basically what I'm getting at is I think Rowling and the WB crew have fixated a bit too much on the bigger picture and that characterization has been (somewhat) neglected. I just hope the next movie will be a course correction on many fronts, or a good step forward.Are these movies Character driven or plot driven?"

In my opinion is that a great oppurtunity to keep fans in the franchise when there are gaps of several years between the movies.

But I am a bit worried, because in the most cases,  the adaptions release just a few months after the movie or even at the same time, like they did with the Harry Potter games from EA.

0,"Disclaimer: I posted this 6 months ago on FBAWTFT subreddit with minimal responses. I didn't even realize there was a subreddit that was much more active.

Everybody knows how controversial Aurelius Dumbledore was but here I am trying to think of a way that it all works and is also interesting enough that it would be a nice reveal rather than a lame one.

First thing to realize is that we know very little about Kendra Dumbledore. What we do know is all second-hand information colored by people's perception of her.

I postulate that she wasn't as good-hearted, kind and loving as she may seem at first glance.

&gt;    Muriel: ""...a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, though I heard she pretended otherwise —""

Though this is from the gossiping Muriel, it paints a picture of someone that atleast did care for appearances. It doesn't seem very unlikely either by her actions in which she managed to keep Arianna's condition hidden. 

&gt;    Elphias Doge: ""She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman.""

Of course, outside of gossip, people thought of her as a fine upstanding member of society. Strange perception for a recluse?

&gt;I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and lies, that's how we grew up...

Secrets and lies, that's how she raised her children. It could just be because of Arianna but I suspect that such was her very nature. A person with young Albus's personality without all the talent and power.

Also Albus and Aberforth were in school when she supposedly died and ""nobody ever knew why"" according to Muriel. 

What I say from here on out does not have any basis in Canon that I can find but nothing that contradicts it either.

I think Kendra too had aspirations of greatness. Born to a muggle family she was at the bottom of the barrel but with her marriage and her behavior she climbed the ladder. I suspect that while she loved her children, a part of her also resented Ariana. 

A bit of personal touch here, but while I too love my grandfather who has Parkinson's disease, in dark moments I resent him too. When I can't meet my friends, can't go to the party, can't leave for more than 10 minutes because I have to take care of him I resent him. I sometimes find myself wondering if I would feel relieved when he died.... But I digress. My point is that it isn't impossible that Kendra had these feelings too. And its worse for her because if everything went as it should then Arianna would outlive her.

Despite all of this I wasn't too convinced until I read the etymology of her name. It may seem a stretch but we all know how important names are in J.K. Rowling's story telling.

&gt;Kendra is a name of disputed origin. It may come from Anglo-Saxon meaning ""understanding, knowledge"". It may be a variation of the English name Kenda, meaning ""water baby"", or Dakota, meaning ""magical power"". Alternatively, it may come from the name Kendrick, which is either derived from Welsh for ""greatest champion"" or Anglo-Saxon for ""family ruler"".

Yes, the one I am focusing on is Kenda meaning ""water baby""

What if Kendra went on to birth Credence and decided to leave to America or asked her sister to take Credence so she can live her life freely? Harry thought she looked Native American which may be why Credence was leaving for America. 

(Its just a basic idea in the end. I do firmly believe that the answer to Aurelius Dumbledore's existence lies with Kendra even if the answer isn't exactly what I have thought of.)[Theory] Kendra Dumbledore faked her death."
0,"I keep wondering how in the world they’re going to cover 18 years in five movies, when in two we’ve only covered a year and a half max. Obviously, JK Rowling is an amazing writer and will somehow make it work, I’m just hoping it’s not in a cheesy “Five Years Later” title block. I feel like there was a real opportunity for an easy time jump between the first and second movie - prison time for Grindlewald. He only spent six months in a US prison?? That could’ve been an easy four or five years and the MoM comment about “its time for him to answer to his crimes at home” would’ve held more weight. The rest of the movie could’ve been written almost as is. 

Side question, any idea how they’re going to address Dan Fogler’s weight loss? Depression from losing Queenie? Big time jump between 2 &amp; 3?Easy Time Jump.."

0,"      I’m thinking that Credence is the the awful part of Dumbledor’s soul that he purposely removed. This would allow him to defeat Grinderwald because the part of his soul that made the oath was put in to Credence. He developed his own obscurus through his natural life because he had no identity, parents, etc. and the only part of his soul that existed was trauma and his love for Grinderwald, hence him being with him. Grinderwald must have known this which is why he was able to take advantage of him.  I also believe that credence was then transfigured into Fawkes by Dumbledor (himself) to stop the attacks and save Credence(himself). That is possibly why Fawkes would be Dumbledor’s “horcrux” except a non evil kind. This also connects Harry, Voldemort and Dumbledor because their wand cores are Fawkes’s feathers that have a small part of Dumbledor’s soul in them.My Credence Theory. What do you think?"

If JK’s plan was always to tell the backstory of Dumbledore’s fight, couldn’t she have done it without mixing things up with Newt’s timeline?

Yes, he’s the main character. But in the grand scheme of things he doesn’t really play a vital role in the history we’ve been told in other HP canon.Does the title really match the actual series?"

0,"We all know that the legendary wizard battle between Dumbledore and Grindelwald. So I’m guessing that the movie will build up to that scene. A bit like Infinity War with Thanos snapping his fingers and the huge war. 

So for the business view it’s good that everyone knows that the legendary battle will happen and therefore fans of Harry Potter and every other movie goer will see the movie. So it will probably hit over 1B. 

But now we have Fantastic Beasts 3 to look forward to and then FB4. 

Steve Kloves and JK Rowling stated that this movie will be more light and fun than Crimes of Grindelwald. Which is good. Because many people wanted an adventure with Newt and his friends. A bit like Indiana Jones. So that’s partly why they’re going to Brazil. 

What will happen in FB4? Will the Global Wizarding War happen? Will we get introduced to Tom Riddle? 

I’m looking forward to the 20s especially with the FB franchise. Because I know there’s a lot potential! 

Also while the FB franchise is ongoing maybe we’ll get some sort of First Wizarding War/Marauders movie series? Beetle of the Bard? Founders of Hogwarts? A drama action tv series within the Wizarding World? Because Warner Bros is realising that there’s a huge fanbase and to compete with the likes of Star Wars/Marvel they need a massive franchise.

And I've heard some interesting theories about how they might have been the only ones who could understand each other. I've also been realizing just how similar Riddle and Credence are in their story arcs. And, I was thinking that, knowing that Credence is now on Team Grindelwald, perhaps Nagini joins Grindelwald for Credence at some point. I know she seemed rather distressed when Credence joined him, however, she will have to get darker as a character at some point if she's to enlist Riddle in future. And, perhaps while she's with Grindelwald, Grindelwald learns that Salazar Slytherin has an heir: Riddle, and he teaches Nagini a bunch of stuff about magic, and subtly leaves her with Tom after she transforms irreversibly into a snake. This may also explain how Riddle already knew so much about magic when entering Hogwarts, since a lot of what he was doing in the orphanage (eg. the seven stones for the seven horcruxes) would require some actual prior knowledge, not just magical prodigy (which Riddle also obviously is.)

Because not only is exciting to learn more about Dumbledore and Grindelwald. But the matter of fact that we’re going to see the legendary duel in Fantastic Beasts 5. I can picture it being like the duel in the OOTP between Dumby and Voldy with a mix of the battle between Anakin and Obi Wan. 

Actually I can picture the fifth film being like Revenge of the Sith. Grindelwald is at his highest point, Europe is now ruins due to the World War 2 (Interesting to see how they’re going mix the muggle wars with Wizards and how they’re going to deal with it). 

But to make the three remaining films I think that they need to focus and building up to the big duel in FB5. So while keeping Newt’s story they can still focus more on Grindelwald and Dumbledore. And make Tina more likeable. Then I’m all set. 

What’s your predictions for Fantastic Beasts 3? From what I’ve heard is that they’ll make this one more fun and brighter colours. So CoG was made to introduce Grindelwald and this is probably going away from Grindelwald. 

- Dumbledore sends Newt and Jakob to Brazil to find something to break the blood pact. In Brazil in the Amazon forest they’ll probably get in trouble. Maybe meet a secret Grindelwald follower or some other villain? They could throw some comedy into that. Who knows? 

- Grindelwald is sending Credence to Hogwarts on a mission to assassinate Dumbledore? 

- We’ll might also see Grindelwald getting serious support and maybe see a scene of him in Berlin? Holding a speech. 

But what will happen in the fourth movie? What’s your predictions?Predictions for Fantastic Beasts 3,4 &amp; 5. And why I’m happy that the FB series is now focusing on the Global Wizarding War. (Grindelwald and Dumbledore)."

*Percival Graves interrogates Newt Scamander. Tina Goldstein, in shackles, watches on in fear.*



One of the best scenes in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the interrogation scene is not what it appears. Exchanges are loaded with subtext. So much goes on beneath the surface. 



**1. Newt ❤️ Tina**

Newt initially has no interest in Graves. He twists in his seat and directs his answers to Tina. He needs her to understand that his creatures are harmless, that he is not reckless. Why? He’s telling her he likes her. He needs her to know he’s not a bad guy. He’s sorry for betraying her trust and wants her to like him too. 



**2. Gellert 💜 Albus**

“What makes Albus Dumbledore so fond of you?”

Percival Graves is Gellert Grindelwald. And Grindelwald wants to know, for very personal reasons, why Albus Dumbledore is fond of this good-looking young wizard. Newt’s modest answer gives no reason for jealousy. 



**3. The Obscurus**

Graves wants information from Newt, the magizoologist, about the Obscurus. Newt has an Obscurus contained and protected — benign compared with the raging tornado of Creedence. Graves takes advantage of the police-interview setting to learn more about the Obscurus, to better manipulate Creedence’s Obscurus and execute his evil plan. 



**4. Grindelwald Revelio’d**

Graves asks, “So it’s useless without the host?” And here he gets Newt’s attention. With this line of inquiry Grindelwald reveals his evil intentions: he Revelio’s himself. Graves-Grindelwald sentences Newt and Tina to immediate death, to protect the secret of his identity. 



**5. Villain monologue?**

Graves gives a *disguised* villain monologue. He accuses Newt of using the Obscurus to break the statute of secrecy and start war between the magical and non-magical worlds. *This is Grindelwald’s plan!* Graves accuses Newt of doing exactly what he’s been trying to do with the Creedence-Obscurus!

0,"Like, I’m aware there are fans that have issues with it, but from what I’ve seen, ironically, some of the people with the most scathing, dismissive takes on the film and it’s story are people who report to have no interest in the franchise.

I’ve literally just read an article comparing Crimes of Grindelwald to Solo (as if CoG wasn’t more financially successful than Solo by a long shot), saying that Fantastic Beasts was hashing out information fans “already knew” - um...no. 

Crimes of Grindelwald, unlike Solo, isn’t a standalone: it’s a film that’s a part of a series-long story that you’re preemptively hating for no reason at all. The story in question has no established brand name and started with no familiar or before-seen characters and locations. 

And yet the people who are accusing Fantastic Beasts of being a cash grab think that a play, that has a pretty goofy, shitty story that was much more widely criticized *by the core fan base*, is not a cash grab? That we really need to adapt a play into an 8th goddamn film that includes hardly any significant new characters, has no new locations, and doesn’t really do anything interesting? 

This “Cursed Child movie” BS is really just excitement being cooked up by clueless non-fans who have a limited, movie-exclusive knowledge of the extent of Rowling’s world-building, who have limited investment in this story, and who are just rooting for a shallow story to come to the screen that doesn’t take any effort for their lazy selves to invest in and understand. IMO. To these people, these stories can’t have new, political, complex, dark, or different content whatsoever. It has to be Hogwarts and Harry Potter - over and over and over again. 

A Cursed Child movie would be the definition of a lazy cash grab. Fantastic Beasts is so much more dynamic, mature in tone, original, and artistically impressive. To trash FB but root for a Cursed Child adaptation as something people actually want is so laughably hypocritical, ironic, and unaware. 

This is where I get sort of irritated at “movie-fans”, or the type of HP fan that only bought into the Potter phenomenon for really ephemeral, basic stuff like Hogwarts houses and Quidditch and world-building details that might’ve charmed them, rather than anything really story related. 

I don’t want to gatekeep, but I feel like, because of the fact that the original story was split into two different mediums, there isn’t as wide an audience for the story of this franchise as there is for the really basic world-building. I feel like a larger portion of the fan base for Harry Potter just sort of entertained the films because they looked cool, or had a certain ambiance that they enjoyed, but wrote the story off because they didn’t really want to read the books, and made the assumption that it was just a simple “good vs evil” parable of the kind they’ve seen before. 

I mean, seriously; people hardly seem to be able to recognize this series outside of a Wizarding School. You had a huge contingency of people who just thought Hogwarts was the extent of the world. People who read the books obviously understood the extent of the world more, and so weren’t so taken out of it when the community completely changed and we weren’t inside of a school any longer. I don’t think a lot of people really care about “The Wizarding World” - the only thing they cared about was Hogwarts. 

Which is where the “movie fan vs book fan” issue comes in. There’s a huge split in the audience here, and the level of story investment, that doesn’t exist for franchises like Star Wars and Marvel, where the entire original story is told on screen. You have a contingency of fans who really don’t understand the Wizarding World developments, aesthetically and narratively, because they’re directly from Rowling; they’re hugely reliant on you having *read* the Potter series, not watched it. Non-fans and movie fans have a way more limited, conservative, and sometimes even skewed perception of what Harry Potter, and the Wizarding World, is like, tonally, aesthetically, structurally, narratively...

I think it’s interesting that the darkest, most inaccessible, “shocking to the audience” films were produced and written by Rowling herself - the visions she produces are the ones that the wider movie going audience doesn’t have a taste for. Because they expect kids content, of the type Chris Columbus might’ve produced; ever since those first two films were made, they’ve cast a shadow over how people see Potter. Rather than looking at the series as the darker, gothic fantasy coming of age story that it is, family movie goers just assumed it was “kids stuff” - which is why there’s so much conjecture around how “dark” each new installment is. Which wouldn’t really be a surprise to anyone who knew Rowling’s voice and writing style from her writing, either in Potter or her other books. But ever since Prisoner, the constant refrain was shock about how “dark and adult” it was. 

I think people undersell the harshness of the content, and misrepresent it as something that’s for a very young audience that it isn’t really for. I know this is sort of a tangent, but I’ve noticed this CONSTANT, low-level attempt by un-invested viewers and critics to lambast each new installment for the “self-serious”, “grim” nature of the content, and I can’t help but think “how patronizing and arrogant”. 

I feel like people are trying to police and harass Rowling into not taking “serious”, “dark”, or “adult” thematic and narrative risks, out of some shitty interpretation/feeling that her stories are supposed to be wholesome, light, and fun in deference to “their childhoods!” and “the Children!” Who diminished as an audience for the series almost since the film series began. It’s  never been her style, to be overtly-comedic, straightforward, and light. No one would like her stories if they pandered to kids and families in the way Marvel and SW have.[RANT] Is no one else frustrated by the pre-determined Fantastic Beasts franchise hatred being peddled by the same non-fans who are excitedly sharing rumors of a Cursed Child movie, as if that’s something fans like or want more?"

I just don’t know if I want another search for the thing to destroy the bloodpacts like DH.Might be the only one.

0,"J.K Rowling has already established that Picquery is a Horned Serpent, Tina is a Thunderbird, Queenie is a Pukwudgue, and Jacob would be a Wampus if he were a wizard. So, I was thinking, what would the houses of the other characters be? I'll make some guesses myself, but feel free to add other characters to the list.

Albus Dumbledore - Horned serpent
Abernathy - Wampus
Credence - Thunderbird
Newt - Pukwudgie
Theseus - Horned serpent
Leta - Wampus
Vinda - Pukwudgie
Gellert Grindelwald - Horned serpent/ Wampus
Yusuf Kama - Horned serpent
Nagini - PukwudgieWhat do you think the Ilvermorny houses of the Crimes of Grindelwald characters would be?"

0,"I’m making this prediction here because I think it’s incredibly likely but so far there’s been no confirmation whatsoever.

I’m certain young Hagrid will be an important character in the next movie, possibly all the rest of them.  Dumbledore’s final duel with Grindelwald takes place in 1945, three years after Hagrid is expelled, which is around the time the series is currently set.  Suspecting Hagrid’s innocence and knowing his affection for all sorts of creatures, I believe Dumbledore will send him off to team up with Newt, since he no longer has to worry about getting an education.  At the end, Hagrid will start his groundskeeping duties.

Aside from how it makes sense in terms of timing and characters, this would be completely in keeping with JK’s writing style for these movies.  She adds in a ton of nostalgia for her books, going so far as to change Dumbledore’s teaching subject to recreate a classic scene and changing McGonagall’s age so she could be added. Adding a young Hagrid makes too much sense for her not to do it.Fantastic Beasts 3 Prediction"

0,"&gt;*Aurors are the Wizarding World's best defence against the practitioners of the* *Dark Arts. We're well-versed in* *offensive magic, because our very lives depend on it. It takes courage, wit and guile.*

Aberforth was:

* An experienced and talented [**duelist**]( 
* Observant (Sirius noted that Aberforth had a good memory for who he has thrown out of his tavern)
* A shrewd and dispassionate tactician (he suggested to Harry to hold Slytherin  students hostage against their parents who also served as Death Eaters)
* An informant, relaying useful information of what transpired at the Hog's Head

I ask mostly because I wonder if there's a chance we'll see Aberforth being more engaged in the action in upcoming FB films. He also has a personal history with Grindelwald, of course. He had inside knowledge of what Grindelwald and his brother were planning and he disaproved.Is it possible Aberforth Dumbledore worked briefly as an undercover Auror leading to the first wizarding war before becoming a barman?"

0,"*How Jacob kept his memory...*


In the final scene of Fantastic Beasts &amp; Where to Find Them we visit Jacob Kowalski at his new New York bakery. The pastries have been inspired by Newt Scamander’s menagerie, but Jacob does not recall the source of his ideas. 


Queenie enters the Kowalski Bakery and smiles at Jacob. He smiles back, looks puzzled and touches the Murtlap bite he sustained after walking off with Newt’s suitcase early in the movie. Jacob is the only Muggle in the story bitten by a Murtlap. Jacob is “uncommonly susceptible”. Newt treats Jacob for the bite, and introduces Swooping Evil venom. 


*Conclusion: The Murtlap bite protected Jacob from full memory loss during the mass Obliviation of New York.*


Jacob offers a theory in another movie about happy memories, but he’s the amateur. The Murtlap resistance to memory wipe is more practical and more appropriate to a franchise that emphasises magical creatures. Newt (probably?) lacks the guile to give Jacob a vaccine deliberately. Although Newt knew that Jacob would be Obliviated, leaving him magic-aware is a big risk to the statute of secrecy = illegal. But Newt likely suspected Jacob’s memories would prove persistent: he did after all write the book on these creatures.

0,"Early in COG, Dumbledore says Obscurus is something like a ""dark twin"" of the Obscurial.
He also says Obscurus rises with the lack of love and suggests that if Credence could have a brother or sister to replace the Obscurus ""companionship"", he could be saved/cured. Later, in the scene wich Dumdledore is talking to Leta about his lost, he confess he feels guilty not only about the spell that killed Arianna, but also for being negligent as a brother and havent loved her as she deserved.
Otherwise, even with Albus being kind of negligent about her, we can see Aberforth having so much love to give for Arianna, always by her side, protecting and caring for her. My question is if Obscurus rises with the lack of love and can be cured/controled/saved with the companionship and love of a friend or brother, why the Love of Aberforth wasnt able to do something about Arianna's condition? I fell there is some secret that Rowling will reveal about how a Obscurus can REALLY be cured (yes, I believe that cure really exists)

P.S: sorry for my english, I am a brazilian Girl, still learning lolThe Cure for an Obscurial"

I really hope she is alive because she is my favorite character in these stories.... but I’m not super optimistic with JK’s track record.Is Leta dead?"
0,"So, I think we all agree that in a way or in another Credence/ Aurelius is related to Dumbledore ( not necessarily by blood) because otherwise Crimes of Grindelwald would be based, as someone pointed out, on a big lie. But i think that all the story about Credence, that took a huge part of the second movie, will be essential in the future. I don’t know how they’ll handle it by the way.

0,"I can't stop thinking about the possible great duel between Albus and Newt vs. Aurelius. Anyone else? 
I've seen many people saying that Aurelius' obscurus powers will not be enough to defeat Albus, since in Crimes of Grindelwald Aurelius wasn't even able to defeat Grimson, a regular bounty-hunter that wasn't even trying to fight back. What many seem to forget is that Aurelius' hability is yet unharnessed and untrained, it's the same as expecting a 11-year-old Harry to fight against Lord Voldemort. Aurelius' first ever wand spell was destroying a f*cking mountainside, which I imagine is the equivalent to Harry's ""Give it a wave"" in Ollivander's wand shop. One can only imagine the great heights that his magical habilities will reach after receiving proper training by none other than Gellert Grindelwald. I don't think J.K. Rowling would set up this confrontation so much in CoG and then have it be a lackluster duel where Albus simply avoids his attacks and doesn't fight back and manages to leave unharmed. I want to see some earth quaking magical prowess in action.
And on other point, do you guys think that a Patronus could be efficient against the Obscurus. I mean, we hear so much about how the Patronus Charm is extremely powerful and useful, however, asides from dementirs and a miserable mention to lethifolds we don't really know what else can this powerful spell do. I think it would really suiting to have the silver Phoenix from Dumbledore's Patronus fight back Aurelius' dark cloud of evil energyHow will Albus and Newt Fight a well-trained and skilled Aurelius? Would Patronuses be effective?"
