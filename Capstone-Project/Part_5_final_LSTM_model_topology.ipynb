    "- `RNN type`: Researched that there are 2 popular recurrent cells: Long Short-Term Memory cell (LSTM) and the Gated Recurrent Unit cell (GRU). In addition, Bidirectional LSTM was used.LSTM (model 4) seems to perform better given other parameters are kept constant (model 5). When additional LSTM layer was used, **model 9** produced the best result\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Number of Characters`: Initially modelling only used 27 unique characters which are alphabets, but the generated text did not appear realistic as punctuation is used to convey and clarify the meaning of written language. In addition, it gives structure to the sentence, hence necessary punctuations are included. the final 36 characters are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `epoch`: An epoch is an iteration over the entire x and y data provided. From the observation, more epoch allow more iteration over the train and test set, hence there were better `accuracy` and lower `loss` score in general as epoch increases. `epoch` were not increased beyond 100 as based on the `accuracy` and `loss` plot, they started to plateau after 60 `epoch`\n",

    "- `personal judgement`: even though many of the models' accuracy score plateau to 0.76, how effective the RNN model is judged by how readible the text it generates, from the different models too. In this scenario, even though **model 9** shows overfitting at 100 epoch, the text generated is the most understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In conclusion**: Even though model 9 shows overfitting, it has the highest accuracy and lowest loss with the most understood text. By adding 1 extra layer of LSTM with dropout layers, the text became more readable & realistic. For future improvements, the LSTM model can be made more complex with more layers or include embedding too.\n",
