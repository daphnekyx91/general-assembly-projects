    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Coursera is a massive open online course (MOOC) platform that offers online courses, certifcations in collaboration with other recognised universities and business organisations. As the courses are conducted online, they are highly accessible to students around the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a surge in MOOC participation and service providers, and the MOOC industry is forecasted to reach USD 18925.18 million and 100 million learners by 2026. With the rise of the 4th Industrial revolution, more employers are upgrading their skillsets to deal with the ever-changing technological disruption in their industries. In addition, due to the unfortunate outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020, momentum towards online learning as exponentially grown as it reduces the risk associated with in-person teaching.\n",
    "\n",
    "As MOOCs are conducted remotely, feedback from the course content are in the form of `rating` and `reviews` submitted by students.\n",
    "In this project, we attempt to analyse what are the `reviews` that leads to the different `rating` *(For example, why did this reviewer rate 5(highest)) but the other reviewer rate less than 5* and find the best classification models that can classify submitted `reviews` to their corresponding `rating`.From understanding what words help to classify 5.0 rating, we can improve MOOC satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, this project also attempt to generate fake positive reviews using Recurrent Neural Network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this capstone project, datasets **Coursera_courses.csv** and **Coursera_reviews.csv** are used from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/imuhammad/course-reviews-on-coursera?select=Coursera_reviews.csv). **Coursera_courses.csv** contains data like the course name and institutions while **Coursera_reviews.csv** contain reviews and rating left by each reviewer.\n",
    "Both of the datasets are merged on the 'key' column. Now the dataset is combined into 1 dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were reviews left in other languages and a combination of NLP libraries are used to translate `reviews` to english.\n",
    "**Regular Expression** is used to clean up the text. **nltk.corpus** is used to filter out the non-english `reviews`.\n",
    "**SpaCy** is used to detect the different languages. **google_trans_new** is a free python API for google translate,\n",
    "the non-english `reviews` are translated in separate batches to prevent exceeding the request limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the translation is complete, duplicated posts are removed and minimum 'count of words'= 5 are used. `Reviews` with `rating` 5.0 are mapped to 1 while `Reviews` with `rating`less than 5.0 are mapped to 0. The `reviews` are further preprocessed to remove digits, symbols and url links. `Reviews` with and without `rating` 5 and plotted on **WordClouds** - visual representations of words that give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently. This provides a visual signal of which words may help in classifying the 2 types of reviews. **pyLDAvis** is also used to interprete possible topics from the `reviews`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataframe is then split into random train and test subsets using train_test_split.The `reviews` are preprocessed further using Porter Stemmer to generate the root form of the inflected words. Countvectorizer is used to convert the text in `reviews` to numerical data before using different Classification models for binary classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were many Classification models used: Logistic Regression, MultinomialNB Classification, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, XGBoost Classifier. With high accuracy score and ability to generalise to unseen data compared to other models (the delta between train and test accuracy score) and low False Positive rate as our consideration, **Multinomial NB** showed the high accuracy in classifying the `Reviews` with `rating` 5.0 (mapped to 1) and `Reviews` with `rating`less than 5.0 (mapped to 0) and has the lowest False Positive rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to classification of  `reviews`, this Capstone project also explored Text generation using Recurrent Neural Network(RNN). With tutorials from [keras.io](https://keras.io/) and fine-tuning, the text generated were easily understood and were able to generate reviews-like text.Recurrent Neural Network with 2 LSTM layer with Dropout of 0.2 is found to have the most readable text. However, more research and fine-tuning are required to produce grammatically correct reviews."

I like it, BUT...\\n_ It lacks of some useful features: saving intermediate results in quizzes before submit them; calendar; limited number of subforums.\\n_ The most relevant flaw: there are not downloadable versions of lecture slides. Unacceptable! No way to check most of the links we saw in slides (URLs not visible).\\n_ Description and steps in course project appear \"too packed\" together. I prefer the former design.\\n2) Related to content:\\n_ The course is mainly for preparing students for the rest of data science specialization program. When you said \"toolbox\" you mean the concrete toolbox you will need to do the program. Some people expect to have a general introduction to data science but that is only a half o'"

There was a clear logic as the professor developed the various ratios. What was missing for me was some in-line quizzes.  Not the “tell me what I just told you type” but rather ones that make you think.  So, for example, in the final video for Week 1, the optional video, instead of just suggesting that the students “play” with the spreadsheet, I think it would be better to give them an actual task or two… “change the assumption about X to <this value>.  What is the impact on the Y ratio?  Why?”  I liked that he showed what numbers needed to be changed to make the share valuation closer to $55.  But rather than just telling us the answer, this would be another opportunity to have the students stop the video and go try it themselves.  With a specific task, it is likely that more students will go and work with the spreadsheet.  This is where '"

Then I saw the existing reviews and was happy to see I\\'m not alone to feel like that: - Overly superficial coverage of theory in videos; too many things not explained well (if at all).  For example: last week\\'s videos are about... 18 minutes. REALLY? I thought we were talking more complex stuff here. If one can be taught this in 18 minutes, then... oh well...- Lots of \"copy-paste  this here\" parts in assignments, too (not much thinking/effort required). - The quizzes are (as in most courses) a joke, they\\'re there just for the sake of it; I just skip them.- Looks to have been created in too much of a rush; I don\\'t know if that\\'s the case, but that\\'s the feeling I get from the content quality...Based on the success of the original Andrew Ng courses, the quality bar is high as are the expectations.
