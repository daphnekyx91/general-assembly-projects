Dr. Sejnowski's contributions help to deepen the mechanisms through which learning is transformed into ""biology"" allowing learning concepts in a less abstract way.

I would like to learn a lot in a short time, that's why I take the course because I have many motivations and projects in mind and just this tool was what I needed to undertake everything I want to learn by applying everything seen in the course. Fascinating research on neurosciences, I would like to know a lot how to improve the status of my brain and what things do well, and which no, for which I would like to have more courses of neuroscience applied to learning and teaching. I hope I can improve my efficiency by applying these techniques, since my available time is not much and I love learning, and I have many projects, I want to learn to then teach and I need to learn more and better in much less time.

At the level of detail that it involves reading, I consider that it is not a course at all basic. I recommend it openly. ",By Ismael H,2019-10-03,3.0,98,Business est,10,2019,Oct-2019,2019-10,en

Essential Epidemiologic Tools for Public Health Practice,Johns Hopkins University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemiology-tools,epidemiology-tools,"This course was a good primer for those who have little or no background in epidemiology and public health. In particular, the instructor set the practice of public health in the context of its longstanding history and the tools that were developed by researchers and government officials to collect population and health data, in order to respond to health issues and threats in a way that traditional, individualized clinical practice was. However, the instructor does not necessarily make the learning objectives clear in each week, and often tests on material that was only vaguely mentioned in the lecture videos or was poorly defined. The last week of the course, on mapping health data with GIS tools, is promising, as it introduces the student to powerful data tools and comprehensive health and geographic data available to the public. However, it falls short in that this segment provides only a cursory treatment of these tools, walking through an exercise that does not reflect the practical usage of such aids and therefore fails to provide the opportunity for students to attain rudimentary skills.

The subtitles are in .txt format and not of really good quality. It took me ages to put it in a nice Word document format to make it readable. I would gladly have paid extra to get some decent documents to work with. One text document gives the text of the previous week's lecture! There are several typos in the quizzes. This does not give a professional impression. The additional reading list is hardly any help as most of the documents mentioned are behind a paywall, if they can be found at all. I don't understand why it wasn't possible to add links leading to the documents and why ESCP Europe could not provide some of the PDFs directly. Some content was outdated, the videos seem to be from around 2012 and it does show a bit.

For those of us native speakers of Latin America, this is very confusing and overwhelming, even more to solve the questionnaires of the same lessons, based on expressions that we have never heard or used before. While the variety of a language is important and necessary, precisely, because it is a ""style correction"" course, the program should make an effort to use a more neutral Spanish, since many professionals who have taken it, we make corrections of style within our Latin American context.

There is no talk of generalities, but specific issues are treated, very specific (for example, issues of concordance), which is useful because those are the typical doubts that usually arise in the translation process. The teacher is very thorough, which is appreciated. I also liked the interviews and the one who has interviewed people from different profiles and with points of view, sometimes, to contrary. I have not given him five stars because I think, even if he is told repeatedly that the adequacy of the original translation is not valued, there are moments (point, yes) in which he does in a way, in my opinion, Something risky. For example, there is talk of disappearance of repeated lexical units, but the role that the compensations of the loss of these units are not taken into account through the inclusion of other structures (this time, itself reiterated) in other parts of the text. O Speak about 'boy' elision, when there are examples in which it is clearly seen that the burden of that word is transmitted through other strategies; For example, the use of exclamations or the introduction of words type 'to see if ...!' In this particular issue, I agree with the interviewee (and translator) Ehrenhaus in which no conclusions can be drawn about the quality of a translation by limiting the analysis to lexicographic issues. The same thing about the analysis that is made of the use of 'one' and 'you'. The explanation of the teacher is very clear and I understand why it was changed in the last edition of the guard, but I also understand why 'one' was used at first. The use of 'You' with an arbitrary sense has a higher frequency of use in English than in Spanish and the translation faculties, it used to be recommended by the use of other mechanisms (as some of those listed by Professor Hernanz). It is possible that this has changed, since the influence of English is increasingly felt in Spanish. This, I recommend the 100% course.

In general, the information is very complete and well explained, the interviews are very interesting and perfectly complement what is studied in the course. However, I think it has negative points that highlighting: the excessive dependence on the complementary notes that give the feeling that you bought more a book than a course, that the existence are more focused on the content of those notes and not seen in the videos. I think the biggest negative point is in the weeks 5 and 6 where it seems that you are reading someone's degree thesis since the texts of these two weeks are not coherent in difficulty and language with those of the previous weeks, there are several references In Catalan and English (which would be appreciated their translation into Spanish), the contents are passed to compare the Spanish and Argentine versions of Salinger's work to also add to comparison the Catalan and French versions which I see little relevant to content of the course.

The first few weeks are points that could be useful to anyone even in essays, theses, personal work or others as a collaborator, even for the job of writing for pleasure. However, the last few weeks deal with more specific topics that, I would say, are more of someone's interest you want to focus on the work of correcting texts; For someone who does not interest him much or at least not try to take advantage of that punctual information, it could become a little tedious.

Classical Sociological Theory,University of Amsterdam,https://www.coursera.org/learn/classical-sociological-theory,classical-sociological-theory,"Though I have been studying sociology for 2 years at the university with a number of outstanding lecturers & teachers, this course was still insightful. The main advantage for me was its structure: to look at the particular sociologist each week, repetitively repeating their core ideas (in videos, readings, and tests). While finishing every part, I had a feeling that always appears before the exam - you know, when the whole subject finally becomes understood, coherent and thought-provoking, in a way that you already start to dream of continuation.

The video materials deserve to be discussed separately. Bart van Heerikhuizen is the lecturer that you are never tired of: he highlights the most important ideas usually represented with beautiful and organic illustrations and shows how to treat sociology and its precursors with respect. There were a lot of moments when his words were really touching, often at the ends of the week series: for example, the way he spoke about the times he was visiting Norbert Elias's lectures.

Exercises are repeated, which is probably the only weak side of the course. Firstly it is possible to answer some of them during watching the video, then some of them are repeated in the week test, and, finally, the final test (87 questions!) consists of the week test questions.

Nevertheless, it was a great time, thanks! ",By Pecherskikh A,2020-07-27,5.0,221,University,7,2020,Jul-2020,2020-07,en

On the other hand, the disparate evaluation of partners, although it is a strength to have a holistic look of the process, it becomes difficult to understand how the comment says that the work is excellent and / or a good job and the result of approval It is with the minimum approval. Finally when one accesses the courses of his platform he says he will be dictated by the University of Chile, it is assumed to be the credit of the institution, but then in the certificate exposes ""a creditless course authorized by University of Chile and offered to Through Coursera "", I think and I feel that this information should be visible and clearly explained, before inciating the course, so that once ended we do not find this message.

Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy,University of Manchester   ,https://www.coursera.org/learn/spectroscopy,spectroscopy,"I was kind of disappointed.  Before this course I had done about half a year of spectroscopy as part of labs undergraduate chemistry at community college, and we hadn't really done any UV other than mentioning its existence.  I took this course hoping to refresh and improve my spectroscopy skills and learn UV before I transfer to University.  Sadly, I found the course to be extremely cursory at best.  Perhaps I was just looking for too much.  Maybe Manchester will offer a sequel? If so I would enrol and check it out. I also found the course to be rather understaffed in that when I tried asking some questions on the forums it took weeks for even another student to reply, much less an instructor.  In addition there seem to have been several wrong answers on the quizzes, as well as typos such as 106 instead of 10^6.  Although the staff has addressed a number of this issues I am still waiting on a correction or comment on the final quiz.  Since I paid for this course, I would like my grade to reflect what I have externally verified is a correct answer. ",By Dion S,2018-07-29,3.0,202,University,7,2018,Jul-2018,2018-07,en
