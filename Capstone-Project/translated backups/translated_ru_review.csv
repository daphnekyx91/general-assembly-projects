This is not training, but mockery, and for your money and money is not small. One of the tasks is generally impossible to perform with the template presented by the teachers, it accidentally stumbled upon a hint on the forum from the trainees, it is necessary to change the data type to another (different from the template), then the tests immediately pass.

I would like to note two points at the rate: 1. If you are completely novice in programming, it will be hard. There is a lot of tasks, some very complex, will have to strain. If there is no experience at all, it will be even harder. Testing programs. Your code will be tested by a special run with a variety of input data. Often on some of the tests the code rolls, but the system will not say wherever. You need to deal with yourself and test the code. Judging by the reviews, these are many infuriates, considering that this is a waste of time. This, of course, is not so. To be able to write quality code, attention to trifles, the skill of code testing is what you need to get used to from the very beginning. There are no trifles in programming.

It takes quite a serious preparation or the presence of time to google and read the additional performance all the time. I did not have preparation (the institute graduated from a long time ago, and I did not pay the attention of mathematics due, since the humanitarian), but was free time. The site of Yemelin Alexander in Highest Mathematics very much helped. You can say on this site, I really studied for 2 months the first two courses of higher mathematics of the university))) That is, I ask you to pay attention that it took me a time of 2 months, and not a month as indicated in the program. It was possible to run forward faster, but then there would be a risk of not mastering the material, and this is how the practice shows is fraught with the consequences in the most unexpected moments) 2) requires basic knowledge in Python. I was lucky here. Before that, I have already passed a course with the speaking name, so there was no big problem in the part of the code. You can say more, I pulled the skills and learned interesting conversants, especially at the last week of the course.3) not quite associated with the feeding of the material, or rather, it is not entirely clear for what we talked about some things.
