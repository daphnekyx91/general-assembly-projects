And yet, when I reflect on my undergraduate career (I graduated in 2012), it occurs to me that I didn't truly reach my potential as a learner. The flawed learning techniques I gleaned in high school stayed with me for my college years -- I crammed nightly before exams; I took cursory looks at a homework set's answer key and convinced myself that I knew the topic; rather than admit to myself that I was letting procrastination get control over my life, I convinced myself that, ""I work well under a little pressure,"" or that I simply didn't ""have time to go to review sessions/attend office hours/review my work/etc."" I may have been able to graduate with decent grades, but I certainly couldn't recall from memory the majority of the work I did.And so, I've been left feeling like I've failed myself; like I didn't truly achieve my potential as a learner. ""Who would I be today,"" I sometimes muse, ""if only I applied myself and gave learning my all?"" But I can't play the ""woe is me"" game anymore. I may have not taken advantage of the learning opportunities I had at the time, but I can certainly do better for myself going forward.Taking Dr. Oakley's course, supplemented by reading her book, ""A Mind for Numbers"" has changed my life. It's altered my perspective about learning and memory, and it's given me insight into how brains learn best, and how I can maximize my success and efficiency when it comes to learning. To give you an idea of the impact of Dr. Oakley's insight on my life: I originally borrowed her book ""A Mind for Numbers"" from my local library; when I finished it, I immediately bought a copy for my personal collection -- in part, to have on hand, should my friends and family ask to read it; but more importantly, I bought the book to serve as a reference for myself in the years to come, when I may need to remind myself on the best tips and methods for learning. This course taught me how to learn, something I took for granted during my formative educational years. I can't wait to see where I end up in the future, now that I'm armed with the tools, techniques, and resources I need to succeed!

Machine Learning,Stanford University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning,machine-learning,"Well, this course has at least 3 undeniable cons:1. It exist;2. It offers certificate for reasonable and affordable price;3. It has ""Stanford"" in title.Still, it could be improved in many ways.First of all, it has poor video and audio quality, maybe worst I've personally seen in MOOC. Dear Stanford! Professor Ng is cool, give him room with windows, 1080p camera and microphone! Even less famous educational establishments can afford it.Second, subtitles are also poor. English is not my native language but I dropped subs in my language after first try. English subtitles also have a lot of errors: many words are garbled with homonyms; I'm lucky to have some background in course theme and without it I would be completely lost trying to understand what's even going on.Third, I think this and many other courses are suffering from past teaching system and experience. What is classical teaching system? There is lecturer narrating and writing on the board, sometimes showing something; there are students listening and taking notes. Well, still better than ""watch your master working, nothing will be explained"" method (still present in some cultures), but what century it is? XVII, XIX? We are learning ""Machine Learning"" via Internet, and watching materials being hand-written in process? Seriously? Even basic HTML skills in this days are enough to show formula, where you can get reminders of it's every part by simply moving cursor on it (Wikipedia is one example). After two weeks break in learning it will be very effective way to remember fast ""what's going on, why this formula is so big and what the hell is that squiggle"", and learning process will be improved greatly.Little more HTML effort, and there will be way to live demonstrate curves, planes and how different parameters affect them; it will be possible to let students experiment while learning which is great improvement for learning, memorizing and understanding. These are just examples, but hopefully my point is clear.Quizes are too easy, solvable with ""hey he just said that"" method and some intuition, not require deep understanding. Programming assignments are well prepared and explained, but programming materials amount is not enough for me. Thank you professor Ng for your efforts!

The only weak point of the course is that it is quite outdated in some things because of the years that have happened. Anyway it is very helpful and it makes you very clear about the concepts and functioning of the algorithms, which is ideal to correctly manage the libraries available today. The course I found it super complete and is the one that goes deeper within the Operation of the algorithms, which allows you to truly know how they work. It is not one of the many courses that only help you manage the libraries. In summary, it is very helpful, very complete and super well explained and orderly. Too bad that is getting a little old.

This course greatly demystified machine learning for me. Alvin's lectures are friendly and easy to follow, and progress smoothly from one point of interest to the next, always taking time to briefly recap on precursor topics that were previously discussed.I really appreciate how the assignments focus on the core algorithms and their implementation. Ancillary implementation steps and a scaffolding for testing and viewing the results are already given for the learner to use, play with, and go back and reference for educational purposes if need be, for refreshing on use of tools such as plotting methods. The way the assignments are structured, putting emphasis on filling in the gaps with implementation of the important algorithms, makes completing assignments a very satisfying and fulfilling experience. I feared I would get caught up in preliminary steps, i.e. getting plots to display correctly or cleaning up the data, but that's all taken care of so that one can focus on practicing the techniques most relevant to the topic and algorithms.I only wish there were more assignments to complete, both to cover more of the course's material and to have more chances to practice algorithm prototyping in Octave/Matlab.

For my part this course was very useful as an introduction to financial markets, full of examples and that changed my perspective of financial markets. I have read the opinions of the course and are very varied, but there is a special thing that bothered me too much. A subject named James R. says to be a doctor (I do not know what) and have almost 20 years of entitular teacher (who knows where). He is criticizing the course claiming that there are many things not explained or that they are not in the course. However, I think it is enough to put the definition on the Internet to find it. While many formulas are not explained, I am sure that reason is because in order to explain where they would need more theory.

Classes are extremely didactic and well elaborated, which makes familiarization with the concepts of neural networks (and mathematics behind them) more natural. Assessments have both a theoretical component (quizzes, most focused on verification of knowledge) as a practical (programming exercises). As much as it is positive to be the practical component, I would say that it could be a little less ""guided"" - in practice, what they ask is that the student ""Complete the gaps"" in a program already structured (and practically completed) by teachers. I felt the need to complement these exercises with self-account attempts by programming the zero algorithms to ensure that I can implement what I learned. This step is significantly harder than the course programs (after all, implementing a zero project is essentially challenging).

Spanish: The course really liked it a lot! The only thing I really did not like was that it is supposed to be a course to do it anywhere in the world, and it is not so unfortunately. Because to do well, you have to know absolutely everything from Europe at a cultural level. I knew the brands for my trips and for seeing them on social networks, but really in many questions I was difficult for me to respond, not because I did not know the content but because it was something more cultural than of knowledge of the course. It would be nice that they do not think only that everyone who performs the course knows absolutely the history of each European or US brand putting it as examples in the tests. Beyond that, the course is very didactic and enriching. I would recommend it, but only to people who have a prior knowledge of trademarks and European history. Thank you.

The part of the foreign professionals who form in the intervention with deaf people is insufferable - do not move, do not gesticulate, have no rhythm - and that seriously damages both the content that in that particular case is very weak and the transmission. The content in that section is summarized in minutes and minutes of video talking about links from a website, I think it is easier to put a PDF with the links and point. In particular there is one where the professional is recorded sitting in an armchair, without looking at camera, talking about links and links to webs that does not contribute great thing.

First of all, the materials should be reviewed, since in occasions the information turns out to be extremely repetitive, therefore in occasions the attention is lost.

Finally, I consider extremely important to spread among those assigned to the course, the ethical relevance of this work; That is, emphasize that not because they have taken the course we can solve all situations: you have to be critical with our practice always seek to prepare more to be trained and attend to these situations.

Python for Data Science and AI,IBM,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai,python-for-applied-data-science-ai,"I strongly suggest that you look into other providers for learning python for data science. As has been outlined by other reviewers, this is mostly a bad ad for IBM's Watson and there is little actual instruction for actually using Python.  As a background I'm a EE with a lot of hardware coding experience (Verilog as well as Perl).  I completed a specialization in Python from another provider and this gave me quite a bit of help as those classes were clear, with a good progression.  In addition I've now written a bit of Python for work so I have a good base.  This IBM course has, at best, cursory instruction on using Python, Numpy, and Pandas.  The instructions are not clear, with poor sentence structure, and terrible grammar, making it difficult to follow along.  Further, Watson is a confusing mess with instructions that use a prior UI, making it tough to figure out exactly what needs to be done to set up an environment.  Avoid.  Just avoid.  Go to UMich or JHU.  Anywhere but IBM.  The only thing I *did* get from this class is that I don't want to go into Data Science: living in Jupyter notebooks is miserable.  But then, I would also rather build things than write reports.  Your mileage may vary. ",By Nicholas B,2020-07-29,1.0,229,Business est,7,2020,Jul-2020,2020-07,en

I came feeling proud to be able to go doing the free courses
granted by the so ""prestigious"" Stanford University, for its good
educational quality, but with what I just saw, in terms of human quality
It has left much to be desired. When I completed the courses so happy with
excellent notes, was totally arranged to buy my certificates, until
that I saw the following message ""when scoring this box, I recognize that I provided
My legal name, that I am over 13 years old and that I am not from Iran, Sudan, Crimea or Cuba. "" When reading this comment,
I began to feel indignant, pain, because it is entirely racist that for you
country of origin do not accept people from those countries Do you have something wrong with
be there? Are they fewer people to come from those countries? Do not they have the right to
Learn perhaps? I found it sad and outrageous that in the 21st century, they exist
Still this kind of exclusions, deceptive requirements are handling. No
they can have a certificate to come from those countries then, for that and with
my sincere apologies, I do not accept or accept any of the certificates,
because I can not have something like that in my curriculum, something while I enjoy it
Others by their country can not have it, then I consider it too unfair.
On my behalf and for the love that I have for people without distinction of
Nationality, I do not accept certificates. I have nothing to thank while
Keep seeing this limitation towards those countries. Greetings. ",By Tamara B M ,2020-05-02,1.0,232,University,5,2020,May-2020,2020-05,en

Convolutional Neural Networks,DeepLearning.AI,https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks,convolutional-neural-networks,"Este curso introductorio es estupendo para aprender desde cero sobre convolutional neural networks.

Professor Andrew Ng, makes very comprehensible the content of the course.
 
Here why:

-He decompose every element of CNN. Convolutions, 1x1 convolutions and  pooling are very well explained, then by yourself can derive the dimensions of the output after applying these operations.
-He make notes on the fly for derive equations and  explain the purpose of the equations.  For me is much better that  only show slides, because makes give me the oportunity to think of the equation before is show.
-Professor give you  Intiition in every topic.
- He Make several examples of modern architectures of CNNs.Always write down in detail the architectures. 
-Clear notation, uses the same notation in programming exercises 
-Programming exercises are the best documente ones. This makes relatively easy to implement the exercises. If struggle with operations, they provide links to the documentation necessary.

Was an amazing course. 

Althogth I always think CNNs were some what  difficult and sometimes tedious topic (because of convolution and pooling arithmetic, and the use of ""volumes"" instead of matrices), this course make all clear and natural.

I would definitely change some things: the first is that for me the intention to take the course is to make me reliable and revised information to learn more accounting, letting us attempt that imply (usually) seek content on the one side makes us lose A long time and on the other hand you can take us to get information that may not be correct. The second is the dynamics where we qualified the tasks among the participants of the course Who is really qualified to be able to issue an opinion or assessment of another's response? When we do not even know if we ourselves have the right answer. I think there could be more content and more partial examinations to reinforce. Third and finally, those that we take this type of courses is because we are in contact with financial statements and we want to understand them better, ideally to do exercises to compose basic financial statements and thus be able to identify as the items formed, how they square and as The flow of the company is determined. The latter although it is explained in this course, at this moment I do not feel with knowledge to be able to do or explain a real cash flow.

These are my comments: 1) While it attracted the topic for being very novel and because I have been investigating more than 3 years and taking courses related to Lean, I could not feel at a flow in what was being delivered. Thanks the videos of the week 5 I was able to find something that allowed me to close and conceptualize.2) While from the beginning a student may notice that the central challenge is in the application of Lean in construction, I think there are no examples very concrete that they have made me clear what the improvements and advantages of their use in that market.3) lack preparation of the rapporteurs: I know that in general the rapporteurs read their when they make videos in courser, but in this case I felt that They were reading the same ppt I saw. They almost always explain the content to paraphrase the same thing but with other words. No advantages compared to Slideshare, for example. Suddenly some rapporteur was entangled, he really read some words or doubted what he was saying. If they left a link to each PPT, it was more satisfied.4) Very static presentation and poc novel. It is advisable to add animations, images or more vivacious drawings, entertaining and that present better concepts or abstractions of what is being said instead of showing the same as the rapporteurs are reading.

I mention some that I think they do not have a presentation even more so even being a course promoted from the academy and by a prestigious university of Chile: 1) The verbal expression by teachers in each of the videos is very unfortunate, a language As valuable and extraordinary as Castilian mistreat him in a disappointing way, especially in the presentations of the Teacher Peace, there is no correct phonetic or grammatical structure in dialogues, intonation and vocalization. Apparently they made a terrible translation of the content of the English language to Spanish and only limited themselves to reading them through the projection of the visual slides. 2) In many of the visual aids (slides) the information projected on the platform differed or was different from what teachers were mentioning. 3) In the projection of the slides, all the information presented could not be appreciated because the body of the teacher was at the forefront by hindering the appreciation of all the information.

He gave me a better vision of the module and discovered very good work of people very interested in the theme of the course. In addition, the comments received are from people who take the time to see the work done and not only to validate it because of it. On the other hand, I suggest you improve the dubbing of the last module. All videos are in English and dubbing is not readable by the color of the letters and the background. This causes you not to pay attention to this module how it would be necessary for people who are not able to understand the English interview correctly. In addition, the lack of testing this module encourages the one that is overlooked by the students. ",By Manuel C L,2020-06-25,3.0,173,Business est,6,2020,Jun-2020,2020-06,en

In a recording of this type, if something is wrong or unclear, the segment and point are recorded again. In this aspect, they seem like amateur errors. On the other hand, it is a course where, most of the time, only read Slideshow and rarely be heard Interesting info or to reflect. The diapo should be material to support a class, not the class itself. For that I would prefer to read the Slideshow and save me the video.

2) The course is very focused on the construction and manufacturing industry, although at some point the services industry is often mentioned, there are no concrete examples that allow understanding the improvements and advantages of its in these and other markets.

3) Although it is noted that both rapporteurs have extensive knowledge of the topics covered, a lack of preparation is evident when preparing the contents to be recorded. There are many gaps between what you read and the idea that you want express with different words and confuse and retake the thread after a lagoon. This is a point to be improved. Suggestion: We should record the videos to correct the obvious errors and continuity in the presentation of theme.
4) A possible additional improvement: upload documentation with a couple of practical examples where the content taught and that would give May consistency and weight to the course, which in my final balance does not exceed a note 5.9.

For example, on the topic of Report A3, what is exposed in its example is not clearly observed. In addition, the image of the teacher obstructs the complete visualization of the content. At certain videos are heard some inconsistencies that could confuse the students. In the theme of Value Stream Mapping, greater emphasis should be made on its structure and correct way to present it. By reviewing assignments to my colleagues, I was able to realize that the subject was not understood and plotted a simple diagram that neither nearby is a VSM. By my professional training dominates a bit the subject and I managed to elaborate it as similar to what a true VSM is, but not all those who take the course have used this tool, so I consider it very important to be clearer and more emphatically explaining it .
