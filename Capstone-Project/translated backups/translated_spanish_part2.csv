Introduction to Probability and Data with R,Duke University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro,probability-intro,"It is an excellent introduction to probability and data. Concepts are explained really well, one of the best courses (not only among MOOCs). I think it would be improved by adding one week to the course dedicated to solely data analysis in R, as a precursor to the final project. There was too big of a gap in terms of R practice (for those new to R) between what was explained during the course and the final project. I would have found it super useful to have one more week in which to discuss how to treat missing data, how to clean data in R (even if just a simple cleaning, like getting rid of the NAs), followed by steps/do's and don'ts when analyzing data, different types of graphs in R appropriate for numerical and ordinal data, that sort of thing.

Concepts such as correlation, causality and generalization are explained with solvency. For those who do not know, they do not know or have not had contact with Markdown would be worth watching a couple of videos on YouTube. I handled some R, but I had never had contact with Markdown and I found a very useful tool, and although it is not explained in the lessons or in the workshops, the end project of the course must be done in Markdown.

Greek and Roman Mythology,University of Pennsylvania,https://www.coursera.org/learn/mythology,mythology,"This is a course that allows you to know important parts of Greek and Roman mythology and its motivations. There are several theories (often conflicting to each other) to explain the myths and its foundations. Because it is complex, each theory and every part of the story are subdivided into several videos. The themes are complex and at the same time fascinating. The early reading of the books indicated makes the videos even better because they often play interpretations and analyzes that we can not realize when we read alone. The opposite is also very useful, mainly with Virgilio: watching videos before can greatly facilitate the reading of this complex work. (I strongly recommend reading at least the abstracts of all works addressed in the course) New courses about mythological literature analyzes are very welcome.

In the final assignment, however, you are instructed to use the artist layer, and configure many parameters that were never covered in any of the labs or videos.Likewise, utilizing geojson files for choropleth maps was covered in the most cursory manner - you are never requried to open a geojson file, or understand how it is configured. You just load it in and carry on with the assignment. However, without understanding the setup of a geojson file, no student is going to understand how to properly configure the key_on parameter when making their own choropleth map for the final assignment.The ability to actually create a graph from a set of data is perhaps the smallest part of the final assessment.

It is assumed that the questionnaires should be approved using only the knowledge learned through material available in each week. There is also little participation of the instructors, only one person answers the doubts that you may have of the exercises, and most of the time They are answered after a week, knowing that the questionnaires have a delivery deadline every 7 days.

Fundamentos de Excel para Negocios,Universidad Austral,https://www.coursera.org/learn/excel-para-negocios,excel-para-negocios,"I consider it an excellent course. I think it is structured in such a way that it challenges you to truly learn. The final slogan is a great exercise of learning assessment, among other things because of the possibility of evaluating peers. It is a dual-way learning. Maybe you could analyze the possibility of improving the final evaluation, in the sense that in some points the answer is not only white or black. I explain myself in a couple of paragraphs and then I conclude ... The first thing is that in the final exercise - my way of seeing - it was sufficient to make an integral reading and decipher if the final slogan fulfilled the spirit of exercise. I had the opportunity to 'qualify' five or six colleagues' exercises. I noticed in some cases slogans with a modest design (something merely aesthetic -muchos we are not designers-) but they finally met the purpose of the course --ist, I repeat, in an integral way. On the other hand, in another case I warned that each point of the final slogan was fulfilled finged, but the starting point was a table with less than 30 reglots, or a table with more than 100 lines, all items, but not He used the formulas in rigor. Of course, despite the good aesthetics, he moved away from the spirit of what he supposed to do in the final slogan. Dictate the above, and reiterating that it is an excellent course, it would be worth considering if they are handled for final classcation, at least At some points, scales from 1 to 4 or from 1 to 5, with a qualitative equivalent, which allow a rating more in accordance with the integral purpose of new learning, thank you.

I congratulate on the professors Jaume Blasco and Joan Tugards for their good do. I have enjoyed a lot with their explanations and choosing examples. Negative: Since during the course there has been many occasions of the importance of giving voice to all relevant actors, I would have liked to have a greater plurality of political visions to be able to establish a good debate. In the same way, I recommend that a conscientious review of transcripts and even the level of expression of some teachers is made at the linguistic level. On occasion I was unpleasantly surprised by the lexical and grammatical mistakes that came to commit. As indicated in the course, the form is of equal importance.

It would also be good to update the videos of each session, since in recent years, a lot of political and policy changes have been visible both in Spain, and in Latin America.

The objective, the structure and contents of the course are, in general, very good. However, I must
Express my disappointment in two senses. The most pitiful
is that of having found the reviews of their ""works"", which most
of my colleagues plagiaroned doloson and unemployed texts of electronic sites of
Internet to ""paste"", which, in addition, did wrong, that is, they copied and
They hit the texts stolen so incompletely and neglected in their ""essays"",
That fraudulent and piracy acts are scandalously evident. So do you pretend
accredit your application in the study and assimilation of knowledge
required in each and every one of the themes of the course? Is not it paradoxical
and ironic, that the content of the course among other values ​​promotes the
integrity and honesty as elements to combat and prevent the
corruption? Is it fair that we accredit all the course? Do you have - or worse, can it
sanction this cynicism of the affordable ""Copy & Past"" piracy? The second
disenchantment was much lower, because sincerely I think it's sensible and vital to recognize
That everything is perfectible. In this sense, with sincere humility and gratitude suggests
you respectfully consider the review of the syntax and extension
and depth of technical and philosophical content of the scripts of the
Doctors Jesus Espinal Enríquez, María Marván Laborde and Fabiola Navarro Luna. I
I dare to suggest that a philosopher and a lawyer endorsed by a panel of researchers
of the Institute of Legal Research of UNAM will contribute useful suggestions
To the effect. Finally, it is
It is necessary to review and maintain the actuality of the documents facilitated
Participants for reading, not only for reasons of academic value, but
for reasons of professionalism and image; For example, the SNA, PDF manual,
It is a presentation that was elaborated by personnel of the secretariat of the function

The instructor and SWIRL lessons, except for exceptions, is only limited to exposing the functioning of functions and commands, which simple glossary; That is, nothing that one, with a level of English and minimum programming, can consult in any book and / or online manual. 3) Total absence of practical exercises in which one built codes (or parts of codes). It remains the feeling that everything has to be learned from memory (especially in the last week), being that its own practice is what, definitely, allows you to retain concepts naturally. 4) I rarely use the forums, but those who usually use it can be somewhat discouraging, since there are too many unanswered questions (I imagine need more helpers to maintain the interaction).

The necessary time that you should invest is for much greater than the page says, a little more than double time that says, however that only shows the good which is the course3.Many things you have to install, or ""questionnaires"" answers make mistakes, there you have to make use of your knowledge on computers, seeing the questions that are in the forum or asking directly in the search engine, so It is good to read what error you are sending you and know how to find the last I appreciate the people who made this course possible, good work.

The course is very well organized and lasts very little (4 weeks), which is more than enough, since the most basic functions of R are covered (in addition to any not so basic). The teacher has explained the classes with enough calm as even to take notes during the explanation. Before doing the course, he thought of R as a language too complex. It is true that it is a language with lots of functions, some too concrete and specialized, but after doing the course I have realized that there are a number of basic functions with which you can do a lot of things relatively simple, about All in terms of simple mathematical operations, elementary statistical functions and graphic representation. All this, much easier to perform if the RSTUDIO environment is used, which is also someduly explained in this course. Today, with such demand in the Big Data sector, this language has become an essential tool (can that the most fundamental of all) very required in the labor market. In summary: Everything perfect by me.pd: Although some student has complained about the operation of the task assessment system, it has worked perfectly (I have been carefully followed by the instructions given in Swirl).

Python Programming: A Concise Introduction,Wesleyan University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-programming-introduction,python-programming-introduction,"A good short introduction to Python programming, which would also work well as a refreshed for someone who hasn't programmed in Python for a while and wanted to brush up on some of the basic syntax. I like the approach used, through using the Spyder integrated environment, and the exercises with extensive notes. Some of the exercises are a little painful in terms of the code we are asked to write, but it does get more 'Pythonic' towards the end of the course. I found the decision to only introduce returning values from functions in the last unit to be rather surprising, and even then it was only done in a very cursory way. On the plus side, I really liked the iterative description of the development of the phone database utility, which tied together everything introduced earlier in the course.The only big issue with this course is that it could really do with being longer, and introducing some more of the key Python modules, together with more of the language features (such as list comprehensions) which people are likely to see in Python code written by others. Overall, though, it fulfils its objective to be a concise introduction to Python, and lays the groundwork for people to go and work through more extensive material elsewhere.

Other observation: in one of the classes of the Nine Week, I am not mistaken, a maximum and minimum temperature calculation program was done from a list of temperatures. In the video, I was with a question about the name of the variables used, Min and Max. They seemed to be in another color, indicating that they are functions in Python. I'm not sure because I do not know Python's syntax so much, but it seems to me that it may be better to avoid using min and man as variable names in order to avoid confusion, if they really are pre-programmed functions of the python language.My thanks for the Work and dedication of the whole team!
