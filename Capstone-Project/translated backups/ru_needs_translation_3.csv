I myself am a programmer with more than five years of experience and I want to say that I have not met so stupid tasks in my practice. The test system is just awful, you tell you the number of the test, which fell apart, it is absolutely incomprehensible that not so. This is not training, but mockery, and for your money and money is not small. One of the tasks is generally impossible to perform with the template presented by the teachers, it accidentally stumbled upon a hint on the forum from the trainees, it is necessary to change the data type to another (different from the template), then the tests immediately pass. This error is already at least a few months, all do not care, it seems that the developers did once and abandoned the course. The tasks themselves are allowed to fill the hand, they are still completely torn off from reality. What is worth at least dates manually in the last task. Even minimal knowledge of the project structure is not given - all tasks are executed in one file, everything is in a bunch, and signature and implementation. Began to undergo this course because of the good reviews and the fact that in principle in C ++ did not find good courses. Well, the search continues. This course is direct confirmation that the consumption of developers and their knowledge in the subject area can not be completely correlated with the quality of the learning provided by them. To continue the courses on the belts of desire, no one occurs, besides the system of the Platform itself, the curses have become a rippled, a month subscription for considerable money at a rate of 5 weeks and with the medious quality of the material supplied.

Also, it can not but rejoice that in this course there is no (at least not yet met) tasks for all sorts of mathematical topics on the type of Fibonacci numbers, the formulas of Geron, Gorner, etc., that is, if the listener is far from mathematics and is studying Programming, pursuing a goal, somewhat different from the creation of programs for solving equations (such as I), does not have to spend a bunch of time to understand the essence of the task and the analysis of mathematical algorithms.4 stars due to obvious minuses.

If there is no experience at all, it will be even harder. Testing programs. Your code will be tested by a special run with a variety of input data. Often on some of the tests the code rolls, but the system will not say wherever. You need to deal with yourself and test the code. Judging by the reviews, these are many infuriates, considering that this is a waste of time. This, of course, is not so. To be able to write quality code, attention to trifles, the skill of code testing is what you need to get used to from the very beginning. There are no trifles in programming.
