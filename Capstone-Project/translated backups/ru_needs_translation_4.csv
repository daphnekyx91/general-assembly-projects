It takes quite a serious preparation or the presence of time to google and read the additional performance all the time. I did not have preparation (the institute graduated from a long time ago, and I did not pay the attention of mathematics due, since the humanitarian), but was free time. The site of Yemelin Alexander in Highest Mathematics very much helped. You can say on this site, I really studied for 2 months the first two courses of higher mathematics of the university))) That is, I ask you to pay attention that it took me a time of 2 months, and not a month as indicated in the program. It was possible to run forward faster, but then there would be a risk of not mastering the material, and this is how the practice shows is fraught with the consequences in the most unexpected moments) 2) requires basic knowledge in Python. I was lucky here. Before that, I have already passed a course with the speaking name, so there was no big problem in the part of the code. You can say more, I pulled the skills and learned interesting conversants, especially at the last week of the course.3) not quite associated with the feeding of the material, or rather, it is not entirely clear for what we talked about some things.
